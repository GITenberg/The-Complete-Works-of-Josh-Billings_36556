<h3>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</h3>

<p>The weird spelling in this book is mostly intentional, and it has been
retained as in the original, this includes inconsistencies in spelling and
hyphenation. A few changes to which seemed more likely typographic errors have
been made, they are marked with <ins title="Example&#32;of&#32;change">a dotted
underline</ins>, and the printed text may appear in a “pop-up box” when
hovering the cursor on it. The changes are listed <a href="#tn_end">at the end
of the book</a>.</p>

<p>Titles in the <a href="#sec-2">Table ov Kontents</a> do not always
correspond exactly to the titles in the main text, this has been retained, but
the spelling has been changed in some cases to match the text. Some texts, near
the end of the book are printed with no title in the original, this has been
maintained too. The <a href="#sec-3">List of Illustrations</a> contains some
entries for non-existing (in this edition, at least) illustrations and the
numbering is not consecutive, this reproduces the printed book as well.</p>

<p>The original printed book was apparently divided into large “sections”,
which were marked only as running page headers. In this version the titles for
these sections are written between {braces} where they start.</p>

<p>Among the many humorists of America, not one is
better known, or more readily accorded a high rank
by the public, than Henry W. Shaw (Josh Billings).
No writer of the present age is so universally quoted
from as he. His name is familiar to every tongue,
and scarcely a paper in the country appears without
more or less space devoted to the sayings of “Josh
Billings.” His ready pen seems adapted to all subjects,
and he is equally at home, whether writing on
the gravest or the most trivial matters.</p>

<div class="center">
<b>PUNGENCY, BREVITY, AND QUAINTNESS</b>
</div>

<p class="noindent">seem to be prominent characteristics of his productions,
while a fountain of the richest wit supplies his
pen with humor, and its waters sparkle and glimmer
like diamonds upon the paper, as he traces thereon
his description of objects in his undisputably original
style. His jokes are always clear and perceptible,
and his satire, pointed and keen, invariably strikes
home.</p>

<p>As laughter is conducive to health, and as nothing
is learned so easily and remembered so tenaciously as
that with which something pleasant is connected,
this volume will prove doubly advantageous, as it
consists of matter in which wit and wisdom are so
equally mingled, that the reader will rise from its
perusal undecided whether he has gained most by its
reading, bodily health, or general knowledge.</p>

<p>Thousands are eager to place upon their tables and
in their libraries a volume which will be a fair specimen
of the writings of this great American humorist,
and the publishers of this book take great pleasure in
being able to offer them an opportunity to gratify so
laudable a desire.</p>

<h2 id="sec-4">BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.<br>
<span class="subtitle">ADAPTED FROM THE LONDON EDITION.</span></h2>

<p><span class="first_word">In</span> the United States of America a “show” is the
generic name comprising every description of entertainment,
being equally applied to an equestrian performance,
a dramatic company, an operatic concert, a
political oration, or a lecture on the geology of the
oil district of Pennsylvania. A few years ago, when
I did not know America quite so well as I do now, I
was asked by Mr. Barnum to meet him on a matter
of business at his celebrated Museum on Broadway.
Every one who has visited New York and called in at
that strangely-jumbled exhibition, will remember a
small room on the first landing, with “Mr. Barnum—Private”
painted on the door. I don’t know
whether any show-case in the Museum was as attractive
to the crowds of country visitors as that little
room proved to be. Though privacy was written on
the post, publicity was ever peeping in at the door.
Shrewd, astute, and <i>rusé</i> as Barnum is, none knew
better than he that the greatest object of interest in
the Museum was himself. Hence he arranged to have
his private room immediately in front of the public
<span id="pg_xiv" class="page_anchor">xiv </span>
staircase, with the door always a little open, to pique
curiosity, unless really important business required
absolute seclusion. In this room, or rather in this
glass-case, for its three sides were of glass, like the
cases containing the wax-figures and the stuffed animals,
Barnum and I met. He conversed about different
speculations he had on hand, and various ideas
which he wished to carry out. Some of them were
very characteristic of the man and his spirit of enterprise.
One, was to organize an expedition to the
mouth of Davis’s Straits at the proper season, select
a very large iceberg, bring it down in the tow of two
or three steamers to New York Bay, put a floating
fence around it, exhibit the iceberg at twenty-five
cents admission, and realize a large profit by making
and vending sherry cobblers with ice from the real
iceberg! Another idea suggested by the man of
many shows was to get the American Minister at the
Court of Constantinople to apply to the Sultan for a
firman to permit Barnum or his agent to visit the
mosque at Hebron, traditionally asserted to be built
over the Cave of Machpelah, in which the remains of
the patriarchs were buried. “If we could only get
the remains of Abraham and bring them to New
York!” exclaimed the <i>deus ex machinâ</i> of the
Museum, rubbing his hands with delight at the ingenuity
of the thought. Then, after a moment’s reflection,
and knowing me to be well acquainted with
England, he remarked, inquiringly, “What do you
think of Spurgeon for a show? Could he be got
over here?” To me unused as I then was to American
<span id="pg_xv" class="page_anchor">xv </span>
can manners, the association of a clergyman with
Bartlemy Fair and Barnum’s Museum seemed ludicrously
incongruous. Subsequently my experience
taught me to believe that some of the preachers of
the United States look at their position from the
same point of view as did Mr. Barnum in wishing to
speculate in Spurgeon.</p>

<p>A “showman,” as well as an author, <i>Josh Billings</i>
is now regarded in the cities of the Union. In
England we would style him a facetious lecturer,
but the lecturing business in America is carried out
with all the arts, formulæ and appurtenances of
showmanship. There are the large posters, the puff
advertisements, the agent in advance, and the lithographs
plain or colored, all brought into requisition.
It is quite true that if Charles Dickens visited Manchester
or Birmingham to read “Doctor Marigold”
or “The Christmas Carol,” he also had his agent and
his yellow window-bills with the black and red printing;
but the window-bill is limited to a size and is
printed in a style fitting to the superior class of entertainment;
while, in America, the posters of the
popular lecturer are as showy and as exciting as
those of Van Amburgh with his wild beasts, or the
Hanlon Brothers with their feats on the trapeze.
Quaintness, however, is an essential requisite in the
placard of the facetious lecturer. <i>Artemus Ward</i>
used to announce in large letters on the walls that he
would “Speak a Piece” at a certain place and on a
certain date. <i>Josh Billings</i> announces in a still
more mystic manner, strongly reminding the observer
<span id="pg_xvi" class="page_anchor">xvi </span>
of Ruskin’s bizarre, grotesque, enigmatical titles. I
have before me, as I write, a printed notice which
reads thus:—</p>

<div class="center">
“ALLYN HALL, HARTFORD.<br>
JOSH BILLINGS,<br>
On the 7th,<br>
<span class="smallcaps">With his</span><br>
HOBBY HORSE.”
</div>

<p class="noindent">The reader who is anxious to know what <i>Josh Billings</i>
means by an advertisement so eccentric in its
character can have his curiosity satisfied by turning
to page 404 of this work. The chapter is headed
“How to pick out a good Horse,” and the caption is
assuredly none the more inappropriate or infelicitous
than are the titular conundrums of the “Seven Lamps
of Architecture,” “Unto this Last,” or “A Crown of
Wild Olives.” John Ruskin and <i>Josh Billings</i>
understand with equal clearness the value of a title
which shall arrest attention by not being too easy of
comprehension.</p>

<p>I first heard of <i>Josh Billings</i> several years ago
when crossing the Isthmus of Panama by that remarkable
railway which connects the Atlantic and
Pacific oceans. When Nuñez de <ins title="Note: “Bilboa” in the original" id="cg_26">Balboa</ins> in the olden
time had his first peep of the Pacific, and beheld the
ocean which no European had before seen, from an
eminence which is now a station of the railway, he
little thought that in a few centuries hence the steam
<span id="pg_xvii" class="page_anchor">xvii </span>
engine would haul thousands upon thousands of
Christians up to the same summit, and allow them to
enjoy the same sight at so many American dollars
each. Terribly prosaic is this earth becoming! And,
despite Schiller and Coleridge, it is scarcely Jupiter
who “brings whate’er is good,” or Venus “who brings
everything that’s fair.” A locomotive or a steamboat
will bring or take you to both; and a railway it was
which brought me to know of <i>Josh Billings</i>. The
incident was simply this:</p>

<p>Midway on the Panama railway there is a station
at which travellers alight while the engineer looks
after his supply of wood and water. A beautifully
picturesque station it is, looking from it along the
road which you have come, or adown that portion of
the railway track which you have to go—a luxuriance
of tropical vegetation meets the eye, overpowering
the mind with the wild profusion of its beauty.
Nature seems to revel in a wealth of verdure. Palms,
bananas, and trees innumerable of every graceful form
tower upwards to the unclouded sky, or arch over the
flower-garnished earth. The trunk of each is invisible;
for creeping plants of the most delicate growth
entwine around the wood, hang in loops from the
boughs, connect tree to tree with a lace-work of exquisite
elegance and sun-dyed brilliancy, and sway in
wreaths of natural arabesque to and fro in the fragrant,
moist, and enervating air. The station lies
back from the road, and, if I remember rightly, is
thatched with palm leaves. As I alighted at it,
groups of native New-Grenadians clustered around
<span id="pg_xviii" class="page_anchor">xviii </span>
me, the younger ones being almost in a state of
nudity. Some offered me oranges, some bananas,
some milk in a green-glass bottle, and one of them
wished me to buy a monkey. Pushing through them,
I made my way for the station, the sultry atmosphere
having rendered me languid and a gentle stimulus
being desirable. I expected to find the refreshment
department in the care of a native, or, at any rate, of
a Spaniard; but the ubiquitous Yankee was master
of the premises, and a forlorn ague-stricken, quinine-and-calomel-looking
master he seemed to be. His
whiskey was something not to be forgotten; nor were
his dogs, half a dozen of which were running about
the place, the greatest burlesques of the race canine I
had hitherto seen. They were all lean, hungry, and
wolfish-eyed. Their tails drooped mournfully, as if
the seething heat had melted the sinews and softened
the bones; they whined peevishly, but bark there
was none—their owner required it all to keep the
ague away. I had drunk my whiskey, become Christian
in my feelings, and was silently pitying the
poor animals, when the proprietor of the miserable
dog-flesh, stationing himself beside me, and placing
his hands on his hips, sententiously observed,—</p>

<p>“Them critturs are the pride of the Isthmus.
They’re a pair of the most elegant puppies in this
State. Nary one of ’em would flunk out before any
dog.”</p>

<p>“They look very cowardly about the tail,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“That’s the way of dogs’ tails on the Isthmus,”
<span id="pg_xix" class="page_anchor">xix </span>
was his response. “Do you know what <i>Josh Billings</i>
says about dogs’ tails?”</p>

<p>I frankly confessed that I did not; adding, that I
was profoundly ignorant of <i>Josh Billings</i>, and pleasantly
intimating that I supposed him to be one of the
guards on the line.</p>

<p>“I guess you haven’t read the papers lately,” continued
my new acquaintance, as though pitying my
ignorance. “<i>Josh Billings</i> knows that there are some
dogs’ tails which can’t be got to curl no ways, and
some which will, and you can’t stop ’em. He says,
that if you bathe a curly-tailed dog’s tail in oil and
bind it in splints, you cannot get the crook out of it;
and <i>Josh</i>, who says a sight of good things, says that
a man’s way of thinking is the crook in the dog’s tail,
and can’t be got out, and that every one should be allowed
to wag his own peculiarity in peace.”</p>

<p>That my Yankee acquaintance was partial to <i>Josh
Billings</i>, and that anything which related to dogs
was congenial with his tastes, I furthermore ascertained
by noticing two scraps of paper posted on the
rough wall of his cabin. I copied both. One was
in prose and the other in rhyme. Here is the prose
one:—</p>

<div class="title">
<span class="smallcaps">Dogs.</span>
</div>

<p>“Dogs are not vagabones bi choise and luv tew belong
tu sumbody. This fac endears them tew us, and
i have alwas rated the dog az about the seventh cusin
tew the human specious. Tha kant talk but tha can
lik yure hand; this shows that their hearts iz in the
plase where other folks’ tungs is.—<span class="smallcaps">Josh Billings.</span>”</p>

<span id="pg_xx" class="page_anchor">xx </span>

<p>Thus it was that I first heard of <i>Josh Billings</i>. In
the course of my voyage from Aspinwall to New
York, while seated on the deck of the steamer, listening
to the drolleries of a group of very convivial passengers,
and gliding along the coast of Cuba in the
brightness, sheen, and splendor of a tropical night, I
heard many of his best things recited, and his name
frequently quoted as that of one who had already
taken his place in American literature. Oliver Wendell
Holmes I had known for years, Artemus Ward
was a household name in California, James Russell
Lowell had become a familiar acquaintance through
the “Biglow Papers;” but who was <i>Josh Billings</i>?
I asked my <i>compagnons de voyage</i>, but all they knew
of him was that he was a very clever fellow who had
written some very clever things. Whether he lived
in New York State, Pennsylvania, Vermont, or Missouri,
no one could tell me, nor could I get any satisfactory
information as to the journal in which his
articles had first appeared, what his antecedents were,
or whether the name attached to his writings was
that of his parentage and christening, or merely a
whimsical <i>nomme de plume</i>.</p>

<p>Long after my arrival in New York the mystery
remained unsolved. I applied to literary friends for
its solution, but all they seemed to know was that
various smart things had run the round of the papers
with the signature of “<i>Josh Billings</i>” to them,
but in what paper they had originated or by whom
they were written none could give me information.
My friend George Arnold, a well-known wit of
<span id="pg_xxi" class="page_anchor">xxi </span>
the <i>New York Leader</i>, knew of my anxiety. Meeting
me one day at Crook and Duff’s Restaurant,
the mid-day rallying point of most of the genial
spirits of New York, he drew me aside and gravely
asked—</p>

<p>“Have you found out yet who <i>Josh Billings</i> is?”</p>

<p>“I have not,” I answered. “Do you know?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but keep it dark. Only five of his friends
have been let into the secret. It would not do to let
the world know. His position would be damaged.”</p>

<p>“Who is it?” I demanded eagerly. “Is it Hosea
Biglow under a new name?”</p>

<p>“No; somebody better known.”</p>

<p>“Horace Greeley?” I suggested, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“No. A still greater man. Can’t you guess?”</p>

<p>“Really, I cannot. Don’t keep me in suspense.
Tell me.<ins title="Note: “’” in the original" id="cg_27">”</ins></p>

<p>“The author is ——” and my friend paused—“the
author of <i>Josh Billings</i> is none other than—President
Lincoln!”</p>

<p>My informant made the communication so gravely,
that for the moment I believed it; especially as some
few days previous, being down in Washington, I had
occasion to know that Barney Williams, the actor,
was summoned to the White House on a Sunday
afternoon, that he spent some hours with the President,
and that on his return in the evening to Willard’s
Hotel he assured me that the President had
beaten him in telling funny stories, and had said the
drollest things he had heard for many a day. That
my information was nothing more than a hoax the
<span id="pg_xxii" class="page_anchor">xxii </span>
reader will readily suppose; but I felt bound to
“pass it on” to my acquaintances, with a like injunction
to secresy, until at length I had the amusement
of hearing that it had reached the ears of Mr. Lincoln,
who laughed heartily at the joke, and pleasantly observed
that his shoulders were hardly broad enough
to bear the burdens of the State, without having to
carry the sins of all its wits and jesters.</p>

<p>Time passed on and business called me to take a
trip one day up the Hudson River to the pleasant
little town of Poughkeepsie. What a quiet, charming
little town it is, those who have visited it can well
remember. I selected the steamer <i>Armenian</i> for my
trip up the river. The Rhine of America never was
seen to more advantage than it was on that bright
summer’s day, and Poughkeepsie never looked fairer
than as I saw it from the middle of the stream. I
landed at a town on the left bank, crossed the river,
went down to Poughkeepsie by rail, and arrived there
late in the evening, I knew of only two staple products
of the place, and they were—whiskey and
spiritualism. The whiskey I tasted, and the spiritualism
I went in search of in the person of Andrew
Jackson Davis, the Swedenborg of the United States,
whose books on the unseen world have been introduced
to the British public by Mr. Howitt. A kindly
Poughkeepsian volunteered to conduct me to where
the great mysticist had lived; but I found, to my
disappointment, that he was then absent from the
town. To console me for my ill-luck, in not being
able to see so great a celebrity, my guide soothingly
<span id="pg_xxiii" class="page_anchor">xxiii </span>
observed that there was another great writer resident
in and belonging to Poughkeepsie.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Why, <i>Josh Billings</i>!” was the reply.</p>

<p>Eureka! I had found him. I had unearthed my
game at last and discovered my eremite in his mystic
seclusion. I lost no time in inquiring who <i>Josh Billings</i>
was and where he lived.</p>

<p>“His name is Shaw—Henry W. Shaw. He’s an
auctioneer, and I’ll show you the way to his house,”
volunteered my friendly guide.</p>

<p>We went to the house; but like Mr. Davis, Mr.
Shaw was not at home. All that I could then learn
about him was that he belonged to Poughkeepsie,
that he had been <i>the</i> Auctioneer of the town for many
years, that he was by no means a young man, that his
address for the general public was “Box 467” at the
Post-office, that he was a very business-like person,
and that he wrote articles for the newspapers, as well
as sold property by auction and acted as agent for
the transfer of real estate. The reader will therefore
fully comprehend how much Mr. Shaw felt himself
to be in his element while writing the chapter headed
“Advertizement,” in which he offers</p>

<p>“To sell for eighteen hundred and thirty-nine dollars
a pallas, a sweet and pensive retirement, lokated
on the virgin banks of the Hudson river, kontaining
85 acres. Walls ov primitiff rock, laid in Roman
cement, bound the estate, while upward and downward,
the eye catches far away, the magesta and slow
grander ov the Hudson. As the young moon hangs
<span id="pg_xxiv" class="page_anchor">xxiv </span>
like a cutting of silver from the blue brest of the
ski, an angel may be seen each night dansing with
golden tiptoes on the green. (N. B. The angel goes
with the place).”</p>

<p>Better fortune led me at last to meet Mr. Shaw in
New York City. We were introduced to one another
at Artemus Ward’s Mormon entertainment on Broadway.
I found a man rather above the middle height,
sparse in build, sharp in features, his long hair slightly
turning gray, and his age between forty and fifty, reserved
in manner, a rustic, unpolished demeanor, and
looking more like a country farmer than a genial man
of letters or a professed wit and a public lecturer on
playful subjects. I can vouch for his geniality, for,
on the evening of our first <ins title="Note: “meeeting” in the original" id="cg_28">meeting</ins>, we adjourned
from Dodworth Hall to the St. Denis Hotel opposite,
and, in the company of a few friends, spent a mirthful
hour or two. The night was bitter cold; but
warm sherry, excellent Bourbon, and jovial spirits
made the bleak wind which whistled up Broadway
from the Bay, as melodious as the music of lutes.</p>

<p>Mr. Shaw informed me that he was born in the
State of Massachusetts, town of Lanesboro, county
of Berkshire, and came from Puritan stock. He said
that his father and grandfather both had been members
of Congress, and each one had left so pure a political
record, that he himself had never dared to
enter the arena of politics. His first literary efforts
in the comic line were published in the country papers
of New York State; many of them first attracted attention
in the columns of the <i>Poughkeepsie Daily
<span id="pg_xxv" class="page_anchor">xxv </span>
Press</i>. In America a popular author has much more
scope for gaining publicity and popularity than he
has in England. The newspapers of the Union
are always ready to receive pithy paragraphs from
clever men, and to attach the authors’ name to them.
The great secret of the popularity of <i>Artemus Ward</i>
and of <i>Josh Billings</i> is simply that which the late
Albert Smith of England so well understood years
ago, never to publish any article, however trivial or
lengthy, without the signature or the initials of the
writer to it. A smart, terse, pungent paragraph inserted
with the author’s real or assumed name attached,
in one of the journals of the United States,
soon finds its way from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
and from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the Gulf of
Mexico. With comparatively little trouble, except
to worry his brains for comic ideas—no slight trouble,
nevertheless—the wit of the Western world soon gains
notoriety, if not fame. His racy article of a few lines
is copied into paper after paper, until his name becomes
familiar in all the cities of the Union. This
accomplished, a new field of enterprise opens up.
Some speculative man in New York or Boston thinks
what a good and profitable enterprise it would be to
engage the funny man whose printed jokes circulate
everywhere, engage to give him so much per month
for a year or two, have some large woodcuts engraved,
some showy posters struck off, some smart advertisements
written, halls taken throughout the country,
and the man of many jokes made to retail them all
over the land at an admission fee varying from one
<span id="pg_xxvi" class="page_anchor">xxvi </span>
dollar down to twenty-five cents. Only a few years
ago the business of joking in public—the joker himself
appearing before the audience—was pretty well
confined to the clown of the circus and the “middle-man”
and “end-man” of the negro minstrel troupe.
Things change rapidly across the Atlantic, and at the
present day the clown in motley and the minstrel in
burnt-cork have their vocation superseded by the facetious
lecturer, dressed in evening costume, travelling
with gaudy show-bills, and having a literary as well
as an oratorical reputation. Not a single writer on
“Punch” or “Fun,” if he had been trained in America
and had written there, but would have thrown the
desk aside for the rostrum long ago. Simply to
write is not excitement enough for your ardent American,
if he can enjoy the applause of an audience, and
make dollars at the same time, merely by being the
mouthpiece of his own jokes.</p>

<p>Bowing to the fate of nearly all comic men in his
native country, Mr. Shaw was ferreted out in his
Poughkeepsie home, and urgently solicited to accept
an engagement as a public lecturer. He tried the
experiment in the Athenæums and Lyceums of his
own State, and succeeding, followed up his new calling
until now he is recognized as an established, legitimate,
and lucrative “show,” having his proper value
in the market, and is assigned status on the rostrum.
He travels over the United States with his Lectures,
entitled, “<i>Hobby Horse</i>”—“<i>Specimen Brix</i>”—“<i>Sandwiches</i>”—“<i>What
I kno about Hotels</i>”—etc.,
and is making money more rapidly than ever he did
<span id="pg_xxvii" class="page_anchor">xxvii </span>
with the hammer of an auctioneer. Many good
stories are told of him. One is that being in Washington,
and asked by a politician there relative to his
opinion of Thaddeus Stevens, of Pennsylvania, who
opposed President Johnson so hotly in the Government,
and who figured as a thoroughly ultra-radical,
<ins title="Note: “Mr” in the original" id="cg_29">Mr.</ins> Shaw replied, “Give me leave to recite a little
dream I had last night. I fancied that I was in the
lower regions, and while engaged in conversation
with the proprietor, an imp announced that Thad
Stevens was at the door desiring admission. Old
Nick promptly and emphatically refused him entrance
on the ground that he would be continually
disturbing the peace and order of the place. The
imp soon returned, saying that Thaddeus insisted on
coming in, declaring that he had no other place to go
to. After much deliberation, Old Nick’s face suddenly
brightened with a new idea, and he exclaimed,
‘I’ve got it. Tell the Janitor to give him six bushels
of brimstone and a box of matches, and let him go and
start a little place of his own.’”</p>

<p>Having described who <i>Josh Billings</i> is, it may be
fitting to add a few words relative to his writings and
their position in the comic literature of America.
Fun is indigenous to the soil, it wells up from the
Western prairie, sparkles in the foam of Niagara,
springs up in the cotton-fields of the South, and oozes
out from the paving-stones of the cities of the North.
The people of the United States are fun-loving and
fun-makers. Of the peculiar character of the fun
a word or two may be written presently. There is
<span id="pg_xxviii" class="page_anchor">xxviii </span>
always some popular man wearing the cap and bells,
and reflecting the humor of his land. At one period
the author, whom all the papers quote, is Sam Slick,
Doesticks, then John Phœnix, then Major Downing,
then Artemus Ward, then Orpheus C. Kerr, and then
Josh Billings. As fast as one resigns the position,
another takes his place—“<i>Uno avulso non deficit
alter</i>.” During the war, joking went on at a faster
pace than ever, and even those who did not esteem
President Lincoln for his patriotism valued him immensely
for his jokes. The jingle of the bells in the
hand of Momus and the clank of the sabre attached
to the waist of the modern sons of Mars, were ever
mingled throughout the long and fiercely-contested
conflict.</p>

<p>Take a little of Martin Farquhar Tupper, and a
little of Artemus Ward, knead them together, and
you may make something which approaches to a
<i>Josh Billings</i>. That Mr. Shaw aspires to be a
comic Tupper is evidenced in the various chapters
headed “Proverbs,” “Remarks,” “Sayins,” and
“Afferisims.” That he has had Artemus Ward before
him is demonstrable by comparing the chapter
in which “<i>Josh Billings Insures his Life</i>,” with Artemus
Ward’s celebrated paper, entitled “His Autobiography.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_1" id="fnc_1">*</a>
But Artemus is great in telling a
story, having an imaginative power to conceive an accident,
plan the action of a piece of drollery, invent an
odd character, and describe his creation with infinite
humor and force. The talent of Mr. Shaw is of
<span id="pg_xxix" class="page_anchor">xxix </span>
another kind. He is aphoristically comic, if I may
use the phrase. He delights in being ludicrously sententious—in
Tupperizing laughingly, and in causing
an old adage to appear a new one through the fantastic
manner in which it is dished up. He is the comic
essayist of America, rather than her comic story-teller.</p>

<p>His first book was issued May 19, 1866, in New
York, by George W. Carleton, the publisher of Artemus
Ward’s Works, and was entitled “Josh Billings,
His Book.” This volume had a large sale, and
was followed in July, 1868, by a new work entitled
“Josh Billings on Ice.” But his greatest success, in
a literary line, was the publication of</p>

<div class="center">
<span class="smallcaps">Josh Billings’ Farmer’s Allminax</span>,
</div>

<p class="noindent">of which the <i>New York Tribune</i>, in 1875, says:—</p>

<p>“Several years ago Mr. Carleton, the publisher
was seized with the belief that a burlesque of the
popular almanac, such as the “Old Farmers’ Almanac,”
to which New England pinned its <ins title="Note: “meteorologica” in the original" id="cg_30">meteorological</ins>
faith, would be remunerative. He suggested the
idea first to “Artemus Ward,” afterwards to “Orpheus
C. Kerr,” and next to “Doesticks,” but none of
them thought favorably of it. An arrangement was
at last made with “Josh Billings,” and so the “Allminax”
came about. Nearly 150,000 copies were
sold the first year, 1870, and almost as many since,
and though the retail price is only a quarter of a
dollar, Mr. Shaw is said to have received nearly
$5,000 the first year, and over $30,000 in all.”</p>

<p>It has been said of <i>Josh Billings</i> by one of the
<span id="pg_xxx" class="page_anchor">xxx </span>
critics of his own land that “His wit has no edge to
betray a malicious motive; but is rather a Feejee
club, grotesquely carved and painted, that makes
those who feel it grin while they wince. All whom
he kills die with a smile upon their faces.” In directing
his shafts against humbug, pretension, and falsity
he worthily carries out the true vocation of the comic
writer. Many authors there are who write funnily
merely to amuse. There is always a higher purpose
peeping out from among the quaint fancies and odd
expressions of <i>Josh Billings</i>. Just inasmuch as
America is prolific of humorists and satirists, does
she require them. The bane and the antidote grow
in the same garden.</p>

<p>Were it not for the satirists of America—of whom
<i>Josh Billings</i> is one as well as a humorist—it is difficult
to imagine to what ludicrous eccentricities the
people would lend themselves. Too self-sufficient to
listen to argument, they are keenly sensitive to ridicule,
and a little of <i>Josh Billings</i> is more effective in
doing good than the best sermon a foreign friend
could preach them. Burlesque their salient, amiable
weaknesses—that is, let them be burlesqued by one
of their own people, not by a foreigner—and they at
once see the point of the joke. In illustration of
this, there was a paper in Cincinnati which was very
much given to use the phrase, “this great country,”
and carried the use of it to an unwarrantable extent.
It ceased to do so when the following appeared in a
neighboring journal:—</p>

<p>“This is a glorious country! It has longer rivers
<span id="pg_xxxi" class="page_anchor">xxxi </span>
and more of them, and they are muddier and deeper,
and run faster, and rise higher, and make more noise,
and fall lower, and do more damage than anybody
else’s rivers. It has more lakes, and they are bigger
and deeper, and clearer, and wetter than those of any
other country. Our rail-cars are bigger, and run
faster, and pitch off the track oftener, and kill more
people than all other rail-cars in this and every other
country. Our steamboats carry bigger loads, are
longer and broader, burst their boilers oftener, and
send up their passengers higher, and the captains
swear harder than steamboat captains in any other
country. Our men are bigger, and longer, and
thicker, can fight harder and faster, drink more mean
whiskey, chew more bad tobacco, and spit more, and
spit further than in any other country. Our ladies
are richer, prettier, dress finer, spend more money,
break more hearts, wear bigger hoops, shorter dresses,
and kick up the devil generally to a greater extent
than all other ladies in all other countries. Our children
squall louder, grow faster, get too expansive for
their pantaloons, and become twenty years old sooner
by some months than any other children of any other
country on the earth.”</p>

<p>Burlesques, such as the above, whether written by
Artemus Ward or <i>Josh Billings</i>, have not been without
their good effect in the United States. The genius
of “hifaluten” as the Americans call it—the word is
derived, I believe, from “hyphen-looping”—has received
many mortal wounds lately from the hands of
the satirists and good results have ensued.</p>

<span id="pg_xxxii" class="page_anchor">xxxii </span>

<p>The writings of <i>Josh Billings</i> cannot be read with
out exciting mirth, without sometimes hitting home,
nor without the reader becoming satisfied that
America has added to her humorous authors one in
every way well qualified to take foremost rank.</p>

<p>For real side-shaking fun, the reader may turn to
many pages of this volume and find a copious supply;
but, if he is desirous of humor and pathos allied, let
him turn to the chapter on “The Fust Baby,” page
383. He will there find that, underlying the caustic
wit of <i>Josh Billings</i>, and a stratum or two deeper
than his quaint fun, is a quiet layer of genuine feeling
capable of comprehending and of originating the
power to express the very poetry of pathos. The
“fust baby” born “on the wrong side of the garden
ov Eden” is invested in this humorous essay with all
the interest which babyhood is susceptible of acquiring.</p>

<p>There is little that remains to be said relative to
Mr. Shaw, except to express the opinion that he has
taken a very worthy position among the authors of
his own country, and is likely to become a general
favorite in England in his character of “<i>Josh Billings</i>.”
Some of his latest papers were contributed
to the <i>New York Saturday Press</i>, under the head
of “Cooings and Billings,” with a commendatory
notice by the editor of that paper, Henry Clapp, jun.,
whose name is not altogether unknown to the literary
men of London and of Paris.</p>

<h2 id="sec-5">KONTENTMENT.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">K</span>ontentment</span> is the gift ov God, as it kan be cultivated
a little, but it is hard tew acquire. Kontentment is
sed to be the same az happiness, this ackounts for the small
amount ov happiness laying around loose, without enny owner.
I don’t beleave that man was made tew be kontented, nor
happy in this world, for if he had bin, he wouldn’t hav hankered
enuff for the other world.</p>

<p>When a man gits perfektly kontented, he and a clam are
fust couzins.</p>

<p>Contentment iz a kind ov moral laziness; if thare want
ennything but kontentment in this world, man wouldn’t be
any more of a suckcess than an angleworm iz.</p>

<p>When a man gits so he don’t want ennything more, he iz
like a rackcoon with his intestines full ov green corn.</p>

<p>Contentment iz one ov the instinkts, i admit it tew be happiness,
but it iz kind ov spruce gum chawing happiness.</p>

<p>We all find fault with Adam and Eve, for not being kontented,
but if they had bin satisfied with the gardin ov Eden,
and themselfs, they would hav been living thare now, the
only two human beings on the face ov the arth, az innocent
as a couple of vegetable oysters.</p>

<p>They would hav bin two splendid specimens ov the handy
work ov God, elegant portraits in the vestibule ov heaven,
but they would not hav developed reazon, the only God-like
attribute in man.</p>

<span id="pg_34" class="page_anchor">34 </span>

<p>When a man iz thoroly kontented, he iz either too lazy to
want ennything, or too big a phool tew enjoy it.</p>

<p>I hav lived in naberhoods whare everyboddy seemed to be
kontented, but if the itch had ever broke out in them naberhoods,
the people would have skratched to this day.</p>

<p class="caption">PERFEKTLY SATISFIED.</p>
</div>

<p>I am in favor of all the vanitys, and petty ambishuns, all
the jealousys and backbitings in the world, not bekauze i
think they am hansome, but bekauze I think they stir up
men, and wimmin, git them onto their muscle, cultivating
their venom and reazon
at the same time,
and proving what a
brilliant cuss man may
be, at the same time
that it proves what a
miserable cuss he iz.</p>

<p>I had rather see two
wimmin pull hair, than
tew see them set down,
thoroughly satisfied
with an aimless life,
and never suffer eney
excitement, greater
than bleeding tears
together, through their
noze, for a parcel of
shirtless heathen on
the coast ov Madagaskar,
or, once in a while,
open their eyes, from a dream ov young hyson contentment
tea, tew sarch the allmiknak, for the next change in the moon.</p>

<p>Contentment, in this age of the world, either means death,
or dekay, in the days ov Abraham, contentment was simply
ignorance.</p>

<p>The world iz now full ov larning, the arts, and sciences,
and all the thousand appliances ov reazon, these things
<span id="pg_35" class="page_anchor">35 </span>
make ignorance the exception, and no man haz a right tew
cultivate contentment, enny more than he haz tew cut oph
hiz thum, and set quietly down, and nuss the stub.</p>

<p>Show me a thoroughly contented person, and i will show
yu an useless one.</p>

<p>What we want iz folks who won’t be kontented, who
kant be kontented, who git up in the morning, not simply to
hav their bed made, but for the sake ov gitting tired; not for
the sake ov nourishing kontentment, but for the sake ov putting
turpentine in sum ded place, and stiring up the animals.</p>

<p>Contentment was born with Adam, and died when Adam
ceased tew be an angel, and bekum a man.</p>

<p>I don’t say that a man couldn’t be hatched out, and, like
a young owl, set on a dri limb, awl hiz days, with hiz branes
az fasst asleep az a mudturkles, and at last sneak into heaven,
under the guize of kontentment, but i do say, that 10 generashuns
ov sich men would run most of the human race into
the ground, and leave the ballance az lifeless, and az base, as
a currency made out ov puter ten cent pieces.</p>

<p>I would like jist az well az the next man, tew crawl into
a hole, that jist fitted me, hed fust, and thus shutting out all
the light, be contented, for i know how awfully unsothening
the aims, and ambishuns ov life are, but this would only be
burying mi few tallents, and sacrificing on the ded alter ov
kontentment, what war given me, to make a fire or a smudge
with.</p>

<p>Thare aint no sich thing as contentment and reazon existing
together; thoze who slip out ov the crowd, into sum
alley, and pretend they are chawing the cud of sweet kontentment,
the verry best specimens ov them, are no better than
pin cushions, stuck full.</p>

<p>They have jist az menny longings az ennybody, they have
jist az menny vices, their virtews are too often simply a mixtur
ov jealousy and cowardice.</p>

<p>Contentment is not desighned, as a stiddy bizziness, for the
sons ov man, while on this arth.</p>

<span id="pg_36" class="page_anchor">36 </span>

<p>A yeller dogg, with a tin kittle tew his tale, climbing a
hill, at a three minit gate iz a more reazonable spektacle for
me, than a slimy snail, contented and happy.</p>

<h2 id="sec-6">MARRIAGE.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">M</span>arriage</span> iz a fair transaction on the face ov it.</p>

<p>But thare iz quite too often put up jobs in it.</p>

<p>It iz an old institushun, older than the pyramids, and az
phull ov hyrogliphicks that noboddy kan parse.</p>

<p>History holds its tounge who the pair waz who fust put
on the silken harness, and promised tew work kind in it,
thru thick and thin, up hill and down, and on the level, rain
or shine, survive or perish, sink or swim, drown or flote.</p>

<p>But whoever they waz they must hav made a good thing
out ov it, or so menny ov their posterity would not hav harnessed
up since and drov out.</p>

<p>Thare iz a grate moral grip in marriage; it iz the mortar
that holds the soshull bricks together.</p>

<p>But there ain’t but darn few pholks who put their money
in matrimony who could set down and giv a good written
opinyun whi on arth they cum to did it.</p>

<p>This iz a grate proof that it iz one ov them natral kind ov
acksidents that must happen, jist az birds fly out ov the nest,
when they hav feathers enuff, without being able tew tell
why.</p>

<p>Sum marry for buty, and never diskover their mistake;
this iz lucky.</p>

<p>Sum marry for money, and—don’t see it.</p>

<p>Sum marry for pedigree, and feel big for six months, and
then very sensibly cum tew the conclusion that pedigree ain’t
no better than skimmilk.</p>

<p>Sum marry tew pleze their relashuns, and are surprized
<span id="pg_37" class="page_anchor">37 </span>
tew learn that their relashuns don’t care a cuss for them
afterwards.</p>

<p>Sum marry bekauze they hav bin highsted sum whare else;
this iz a cross match, a bay and a sorrel; pride may make it
endurable.</p>

<p>Sum marry for love without a cent in their pocket, nor a
friend in the world, nor a drop ov pedigree. This looks
desperate, <i>but it iz the strength ov the game</i>.</p>

<p>If marrying for love ain’t a suckcess, then matrimony iz a
ded beet.</p>

<p>Sum marry bekauze they think wimmin will be skarse
next year, and liv tew wonder how the crop holds out.</p>

<p>Sum marry tew git rid ov themselfs, and diskover that the
game waz one that two could play at, and neither win.</p>

<p>Sum marry the seckond time to git even, and find it a gambling
game, the more they put down, the less they take up.</p>

<p>Sum marry tew be happy, and not finding it, wonder
whare all the happiness on earth goes to when it dies.</p>

<p>Sum marry, they kan’t tell whi, and liv, they kan’t tell how.</p>

<p>Almoste every boddy gits married, and it iz a good joke.</p>

<p>Sum marry in haste, and then set down and think it careful
over.</p>

<p>Sum think it over careful fust, and then set down and
marry.</p>

<p>Both ways are right, if they hit the mark.</p>

<p>Sum marry rakes tew convert them. This iz a little risky,
and takes a smart missionary to do it.</p>

<p>Sum marry coquetts. This iz like buying a poor farm,
heavily mortgaged, and working the ballance ov yure days
tew clear oph the mortgages.</p>

<p>Married life haz its chances, and this iz just what gives it
its flavour. Every body luvs tew phool with the chances,
bekauze every boddy expekts tew win. But i am authorized
tew state that every boddy don’t win.</p>

<p>But, after all, married life iz full az certain az the dry
goods bizziness.</p>

<span id="pg_38" class="page_anchor">38 </span>

<p>No man kan swear exackly whare he will fetch up when
he touches calico.</p>

<p>Kno man kan tell jist what calico haz made up its mind
tew do next.</p>

<p>Calico don’t kno even herself.</p>

<p>Dri goods ov all kinds iz the child ov circumstansis.</p>

<p>Sum never marry, but this iz jist az risky, the diseaze iz
the same, with no other name to it.</p>

<p>The man who stands on the bank shivvering, and dassent,
iz more apt tew ketch cold, than him who pitches hiz hed
fust into the river.</p>

<p>Thare iz but phew who never marry bekauze they <i>won’t</i>
they all hanker, and most ov them starve with slices ov bread
before them (spread on both sides), jist for the lack ov grit.</p>

<p><i>Marry yung!</i> iz mi motto.</p>

<p>I hav tried it, and kno what i am talkin about.</p>

<p>If enny boddy asks yu whi yu got married, (if it needs be),
tell him, <i>yu don’t reccollekt</i>.</p>

<p>Marriage iz a safe way to gamble—if yu win, yu win a
pile, and if yu loze, yu don’t loze enny thing, only the privilege
ov living dismally alone, and soaking yure own feet.</p>

<p>I repeat it, in italicks, <i>marry young!</i></p>

<p>Thare iz but one good excuse for a marriage late in life,
and that iz—<i>a second marriage</i>.</p>

<h2 id="sec-8">THE BIZZY BODY.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">I</span> don’t</span> mean the industrious man, intent, and constant
in the way of duty, but he who, like a hen, tired ov setting,
cums clucking oph from the nest in a grate hurry, and
full ov sputter, az fat spilt on the fire; scratching a little
here, and suddenly a little thare; chuck full ov small things,
like a ritch cheeze; up and down the streets, wagging around
evry boddy, like a lorst dorg; in and out like a long-tailed
mouse; az full ov bizzness az a pissmire, just before a hard
shower; more questions tew ask than a prosekuting attorney;
az fat with pertikulars, az an inditement for hog stealing; as
knowing az a tin weathercock.</p>

<p>This breed ov folks do a small bizznes on a big capital,
they alwus know all the sekrets within ten miles, that aint
worth keeping, they are a bundle of faggot fakts, and kan
tell which sow in the neighborhood haz got the most pigs,
and what Squire Benson got for marrying hiz last couple.</p>

<span id="pg_41" class="page_anchor">41 </span>

<p>All ov this iz the result ov not knowing how to use a
few brains to advantage, if they only knew a little less they
would be fools, and a little more would enable them to tend
a fresh lettered gideboard, with credit to themselfs, and not
confusion to the travellers.</p>

<p>The Bizzy Body iz az full ov leizure az a yearling heifer,
hiz time, (nor noboddy else’s) aint worth nothing to him, he
will button hole an auctioneer on the block, or a minister in
the pulpit, and wouldn’t hesitate tew stop a phuneral procession
to ask what the corpse died of. They are az familiar
with every boddy az a cockroach, but are no more use to
you, az a friend, than a sucked orange.</p>

<p>Theze bizzy people are of awl genders—maskuline, feminine
and nuter, and sumtimes are old maids, and then are az
necessary in a community as dried herbs in the garret.</p>

<p>One bizzy old maid, who enjoys her vittles, and dont keep
a lot ov tame kats for stiddy employment, is worth more
than a daily paper; she iz better than the “Cook’s Own
Book,” or a volume of household receipts, and works harder
and makes more trips every day than a railroad hoss on the
Third avenue cars.</p>

<p>The bizzybody iz generally az free from malice az a fly;
he lights on you only for a roost, but iz always az unprofitable
to know, or to hav ennything to do with, az a jewelry
peddlar.</p>

<p>Thare are sum ov the bizzy folks who are like the hornets—never
bizzy only with their stings. Theze are vipers, and
are to be feared, not trifled with; but my bizzybody has no
gaul in his liver; his whole karackter iz his face, and he
iz as eazy to inventory az the baggage of a traveling colporter.</p>

<p>They are a cheerful, moderately virtuous, extremely
patient, modestly impudent, ginger-pop set ov vagrants, who
have got more leggs than brains, and whose really greatest
sin iz not their waste ov facultys, but waste ov time. But
time, to one ov theze fellows, flies as unconscious az it duz
tew a tin watch in a toy shop window.</p>

<span id="pg_42" class="page_anchor">42 </span>

<p>They are welcomed, not bekauze they are necessary, but
bekauze they aint feared, and are soon dropt, like peanut
shells, on the floor.</p>

<p>Thare iz no radikal cure for the bizzybody, no more than
thare iz for the fleas in a long-haired dogg—if yu git rid ov
the fleas yu hav got the dogg left, and if yu git rid ov the
dogg yu hav got the fleas left, and so, whare are you?</p>

<p>Bizzyness and bissness are two diffrent things, altho they
pronounce out loud similar.</p>

<p>But after all i don’t want tew git shut ov the Bizzy people;
they are a noosanse for a small amount, but sumboddy
haz got to be a noosanse, and being aktive about nothing,
and energetically lazy, iz no doubt a virtuous dodge, but iz
10 per cent better than counterfitting, or even the grand
larceny bizziness. Thare iz one thing about them, they are
seldum deceitful, they trade on a floating capital, and only
deal in second-hand articles; they haint got the tallent to
invent, they seldum lie, bekauze their bizziness don’t require
it; thare iz stale truth enuff lieing around loose for their purpose.</p>

<p>Don’t trust them only with what you want to have scattered,
they will find a ready market for every thing that a
prudent man would hesitate tew offer, and they always suppoze
they are learned, for they mistake rumors, skandals, and
gossip for wisdum.</p>

<p>It iz a sad sight to see a whole life being swopped off for
the glory of telling what good people don’t love to hear, and
what viscious ones only value for the malice it contains. I
should rather be the keeper ov a rat pit, or ketch kats for a
shilling a head to feed an anaconda with.</p>

<p>I would give all the other virtews i hav got (provided i
hav got enny), and throw in a hundred dollars in munny

<p>I would like tew hav courage enuff tew face the devil himself,

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">B</span>uty</span> iz a very handy thing tew hav, espeshily for a
woman who aint hansum.</p>

<p>Thare iz not mutch ov enny thing more diffikult tew define
than buty.</p>

<p>It iz a blessed thing that there ain’t no rules for it, for the
way it iz now, every man gits a hansum woman for a wife.</p>

<p>Thare iz grate power in female buty; its viktorys reach
klear from the Garden ov Eden down to yesterday.</p>

<p>Adam waz the fust man that saw a butiful woman, and
waz the fust man tew acknowledge it.</p>

<p>But beauty in itself iz but a very short-lived viktory—a mere
perspektive to the background.</p>

<p>Thare aint noboddy but a butterfly kan liv on buty, and
git phatt.</p>

<p>When buty and good sense jine each other, yu hav got a
mixtur that will stand both wet and dry weather.</p>

<p>I hav never seen a woman with good sense but what had
buty enuff tew make herself hily agreeable; but i hav seen
3 or 4 wimmin in mi day who hadn’t sense enuff tew make a
good deal ov buty the least bit charming.</p>

<p>But, az i sed before, thare ain’t no posatiff rule for buty,
and i am dredful glad ov it, for every boddy would be after
<span id="pg_46" class="page_anchor">46 </span>
that rule, and sumboddy wouldn’t git enny rule, besides running
a grate risk ov gitting jammed in the rush.</p>

<p>Man buty iz a awful weak komplaint—it iz wuss, if possible,
than the nosegay disseaze.</p>

<p>If there iz sitch a thing az a butiful man on earth, he haz
mi simpathy. Even mithology had but one Adonis, and the
only accomplishment he had waz tew blatt like a lamb.</p>

<h2 id="sec-13">FAITH.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">F</span>aith</span> iz the rite bower ov Hope.</p>

<p>If it want for faith, thare would be no living in this
world. We couldn’t even eat hash with enny safety, if it
want for faith.</p>

<p>Human knowledge is very short, and don’t reach but a
little ways, and even that little ways iz twilite; but faith
lengthens out the road, and makes it light, so that we kan
see tew read the letterings on the mile stuns.</p>

<p>Faith haz won more viktorys than all the other pashuns or
sentiments ov the heart and hed put together.</p>

<p>Faith iz one ov them warriors who dont kno when she iz
whipped.</p>

<p>But Faith iz no milksop, but a live fighter. She dont set
down and gro stupid with resignashun, and git weak with the
buty ov her attributes; but she iz the heroine ov forlorn
Hope—she feathers her arrows with reazon, and fires rite at
the bull’s eye ov fate.</p>

<p>I think now if i couldn’t hav but one ov the moral attributes,
i would take it all in faith—red hot faith I mean; and
tho i mite make sum fust rate blunders, i would do a rushing
bizzness amung the various dri bones thare iz laying around
loose in this world.</p>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">B</span>ranes</span> are a sort ov animal pulp, and by common
konsent are suppozed tew be the medium ov thought.</p>

<p>How enny boddy knows that the branes do the thinking,
or are the interpreters ov thought, iz more than i kan tell;
and, for what i kno, this theory may be one ov thoze remarkable
diskoverys ov man which aint so.</p>

<p>Theze subjeks are tew mutch for a man ov mi learning tew
lift. <ins title="Note: “i” in the original" id="cg_31">I</ins> kant prove any ov them, and i hav too mutch venerashun
tew guess at them.</p>

<p>Branes are generally supozed tew be lokated in the hed,
but investigashun satisfys me that they are planted all over
the boddy.</p>

<p>I find that a dansing master’s are situated in hiz heels and
toze, while a fiddler’s all center in hiz elbows.</p>

<p>Sum people’s branes seem tew be placed in their hands
and fingers, which explains their grate genius for taking
things which they kan reach.</p>

<p>I hav seen cases whare all the branes seemed tew kongregate
in the tounge; and once in a grate while they inhabit
the ears, and then we hav a good listener, but theze are seldum
cases.</p>

<p>Sum times the branes ain’t enny whare in partikular, but
all over the boddy in a minnit. These fellows are like a
pissmire just before a hard shower, in a big hurry, and alwus
trieing tew go 4 different ways tew once.</p>

<p>Thare seems tew be kases whare thare aint enny branes at all,
but this iz a mistake. <ins title="Note: “i” in the original" id="cg_32">I</ins> thought i had cum akrost one ov
theze kind once, but after watching the pashunt for an hour,
and see him drink 5 horns ov poor whiskey during the time,
i had no trouble in telling whare hiz branes all lay.</p>

<p>I hav finally cum tew the konclushun that branes, or sum
thing else that iz good tew think with, are excellent tew hav:
but yu want tew keep yure eye on them, and not let them
phool away their time, nor yures neither.</p>

<p><span class="first_word" title="Note: Normal text in the original"><span class="cap">S</span>pring</span> came this year az mutch az usual, hail butuous virgin
5000 years old and upwards, hale and harty old gal, welcum
tew York State, and parts adjacent!</p>

<p>Now the birds jaw, now the cattle holler, now the pigs
skream, now the geese warble, now the kats sigh, and natur
is frisky, the earnest pissmire, the virtuous bed-bug, and the
nobby cockroach, are singing Yankee Doodle, and “coming
thru the rhi.” Now may be seen the muskeeter, that gray
outlined critter ov destiny, solitary and alone, examining his
last year’s bill, and may now be heard, with the naked ear, the
hoarse shanghigh, bawling in the barnyard.</p>

<p>Kittens in the doorway, the pupys on the green, neighbor
chats with neighbor, and the languid urchin creeps listless
toward the school. These things are all fust rate in their place,
but spring brings pesky <i>biles</i>, and plants them carelessly,
sometimes among the maiden’s charms, and sometimes among
the young men’s. I kan tork like a preshure poet about biles,
just now, for i have one in full bloom growing on me, almost
reddy to pick, az big az an eggplant, and az full ov anguish az
a broken heart.</p>

<p>Biles are the sorest things ov their size on reckord, and az
kross tew the touch az a setting hen, or a dog with a fresh bone.
Biles alwus pick out the handyest place on youre boddy tew
bild their nest, and if you undertake tew brake them up, it
only makes them mad, and takes them longer tew hatch out.
Thare aint no sutch thing az coaxing, nor driving them away.
They are like an impudent bed bug, they won’t move till
they hav got their fill.</p>

<p>Biles are az old az religion. Job, the proffit, waz the first
champion ov biles, and he iz currently reported tew hav more
biles, and more pashunce, to the square inch, than enny one,
two very rare things to be found, in enny man.</p>

<p><i>Biles</i> and <i>pashunce</i>! i should as soon think ov mixing
courting and muskeeters together, for luxury.</p>

<span id="pg_49" class="page_anchor">49 </span>

<p>I hav got a grate deal more faith than i hav pashunce, but
i hain’t got enough faith in biles. <ins title="Note: “i” in the original" id="cg_33">I</ins> wouldn’t trust a bile,
even on one ov mi boots.</p>

<p>I think faith iz a better artikle than pashunce. Faith sumtimes
iz an evidence ov brains, and pashunce quite often iz
only numbness, but i don’t thinkin these smoothe shod times
it iz best to have too mutch capital invested in either ov
them.</p>

<p>But i am out ov the road. <ins title="Note: “i” in the original" id="cg_34">I</ins> must git back onto biles agin.</p>

<p>If a fellow begins tew wander, and git out ov the straight
and narrow path, it is curious how quick he will begin to go
to the——. Biles are very sassy; sumtimes when yer go to
set down, they will get between yer and the chair; this iz one
evidence ov their ill-breeding, and i had one once plant herself
on the frunt end of mi nose, which was a most remarkabel
piece ov bad manners, for there iz no room on mi noze ennywhere
fora bile, for when it iz even ebb tide with mi noze, it
covers half ov mi face. Biles are sed tew be helthy, and i guess
they am, for i hav seen sum helthy old biles, az big az a hornet’s
nest, and az full ov stings. I always want to be helthy—i am
willing tew pay the highest market price for a good deal ov
helthy—but if i had to hav 2 biles on me, awl the time, in
order to be helthy, i should think that i was bulling the market.</p>

<p>There iz one more smart thing about biles; they are like
twins; they hardly ever cum singly, and i hav known them
to throw double sixes.</p>

<p>What! twelve biles on one man at a time! This is wus
than fighting bumblebees with your summer clothes on.</p>

<p>Biles are sed, by the edukated and correkt spellers ov the land,
to be an operashun ov natur tew git rid ov sumthing which she
wants to spare. This is so without doubt, but it don’t strike
me az being a very polite thing in natur, tew shov oph her biles
onto other folks. I say, let evry boddy take care ov their
own biles.</p>

<p>But say aul yer kan about biles, call them all the mean
<span id="pg_50" class="page_anchor">50 </span>
names current amung fishmungers, revile and persecute, and
spit on them, groan,
grin and swear when
they visit yer, hit them
over the head and set
on them if yer pleaze,
there iz a time in their
career when they concentrate
aul the pathos
ov joy that a man haz
on hand to spare, and
that iz—when they
bust!</p>

<p>He must hav bin a narrow and kontrakted kuss.</p>

<p>If he still lives, i hope he haz repented ov hiz sin, or iz enjoying
grate agony ov sum kind.</p>

<p>I hav bin in a grate menny tite spots in mi life, but generally
could manage to make them average; but thare iz no
sich thing az making a pair of tite boots average.</p>

<p>Enny man who kan wear a pair ov tite boots, and be humble,
and penitent, and not indulge profane literature, will
make a good husband.</p>

<span id="pg_51" class="page_anchor">51 </span>

<p>Oh! for the pen ov departed Wm. Shakspear, to write an

ockashun.</p>

<p>Oh! for the strength ov Herkules, to tare into shu strings
all the tite boots ov creashun, and skatter them tew the 8
winds ov heaven.</p>

<p>Oh! for the buty ov Venus, tew make a bigg foot look hansum
without a tite boot on it.</p>

<p>Oh! for the payshunce ov Job, the Apostle, to nuss a tite
boot and bles it, and even pra for one a size smaller and more
pinchfull.</p>

<p>Oh! for a pair of boots bigg enuff for the foot ov a mountain.</p>

<p>I have been led into the above assortment ov <i>Oh’s!</i> from
having in my posseshun, at this moment, a pair ov number
nine boots, with a pair ov number eleven feet in them.</p>

<p>Mi feet are az uneazy az a dog’s noze the fust time he wears
a muzzle.</p>

<p>I think mi feet will eventually choke the boots to deth.</p>

<p>I liv in hopes they will.</p>

<p>I suppozed i had lived long enuff not to be phooled agin in
this way, but i hav found out that an ounce ov vanity weighs
more than a pound ov reazon, espeshily when a man mistakes
a bigg foot for a small one.</p>

<p>Avoid tite boots, mi friend, az you would the grip of the
devil; for menny a man haz caught for life a fust rate habit
for swareing bi encouraging hiz feet to hurt hiz boots.</p>

<p>I hav promised mi two feet, at least a dozen ov times during
mi checkured life, that they never should be strangled
agin, but i find them to-day az phull ov pain az the stummuk
ake from a suddin attak ov tite boots.</p>

<p>But this iz solemly the last pair ov tite boots i will ever
wear; i will hereafter wear boots az bigg az mi feet, if i have
to go barefoot to do it.</p>

<p>I am too old and too respektable to be a phool enny more.</p>

<span id="pg_52" class="page_anchor">52 </span>

<p>Eazy boots iz <i>one</i> of the luxurys ov life, but i forgit what
the other luxury iz, but i don’t kno az i care, provided i kan

<p>Enny man kan hav them for seven dollars, just half what
they kost, and if they don’t make his feet ake wuss than an

<h2 id="sec-17">THE LAM AND THE DOVE.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> lam iz a juvenile sheep.</p>

<p>They are born about the fust ov March, and menny ov
them die just az soon az green peas cum.</p>

<p>Lam and green peas are good, but not good for the lam.</p>

<p>Lam are innosent az shrimps, they won’t bight, nor skratch,
nor talk sassy.</p>

<p>They don’t kno mutch, only to skip, turn summersets on
the grass, kik up their heels, pla tag, plauge their mothers and
hav phun generally.</p>

<p>I luv the lam, i even luv them after they bekum mutton, i
luv lams ov all kinds, i had rather hav one lam than 4 wolfs.
This may look like oddness in me, but it iz mi sentiments
enny how.</p>

<p>Mary had a little lam. I wish i had a little lam, and if i
had a good deal ov lam it wouldn’t diskourage me.</p>

<span id="pg_53" class="page_anchor">53 </span>

<p>Mary waz a good girl—an ornament tew her sekt.</p>

<p>Mary’s lam waz a good lam—an ornament tew hiz or her
sekt, i don’t remember which.</p>

<p>It iz plezant tew reflekt that theze things are stubborn
fakts.</p>

<p>When a lam gits thru being a lam, they immejiately bekum
a sheep. This takes all the sentiment out ov them.</p>

<p>There ain’t mutch poetry in mutton.</p>

<p>Sheep are mutton.</p>

<p>Mutton iz sumtimes prekarious.</p>

<p>When youth and innosense ov enny kind groze old, it loozes
most all ov its lamness.</p>

<p>This fakt iz too well known tew require an affidavid.</p>

<p>The lam iz an artikle ov trade, az well as diet, they are
wuth from four tew 10 dollars, ackording tew the way things
am.</p>

<p>It iz strange that so mutch innosense az the lam iz possessed
ov should be for sale.</p>

<p>It iz jiss so with most all the innosense and purity in this
world—it iz too often brought to the shambles.</p>

<p>I suppoze if i could hav mi way, the lam would stop growing
when he got to be about 8 weeks old; but then, cum tew
think ov it, this would make mutton awful skarse.</p>

<p>It would also make lams dredful plenty.</p>

<p>It would also inkrease wolfs much, for i hav alwus notissed
since i begun bizzness in this world that just in perposhun az
lams got numerous, wolfs got numerous ackordin.</p>

<p>The lam haz a short tail. Their tails are not short bi natur,
but short bi desighn.</p>

<p>During their early lamkinness, in an unsuspekting moment,
and quicker than litening, their dorsal elongashun iz nipt in
the bud.</p>

<p>Not to be mistaken in this matter, and tew plase the responsibility
jist whare it belongs, lam’s tails are kut oph bi
man.</p>

<p>This iz a mean thing for man to do, but man iz capable ov
doing dredful mean things, jist bekauze he iz a man.</p>

<p>I hav often seen
men ov the nuter
jender. If yu don’t
beleave this, cum
down whare i liv and
i will point them out
to you.</p>

<p>The femail lam iz
the dearest little
package ov innosense
and buty
known to natralists.</p>

<p>A femail lam iz mi
pride and hope. I
luv the whole entire congregashun ov them. The mail lam
soon gits ruff. They hav horns which burst out ov their
heds, and when they git advanced in the journey ov life,
theze horns are a hard thing tew kontradicket.</p>

<p>I hav seen an aged mail lam knock a 2-hoss waggon into
splinters with one blo ov their horns.</p>

<p>This iz terrible if true.</p>

<p>The mail lam when he arrives at hiz majority iz called a ram.</p>

<p>The lam iz kivvered from childhood with a softe coating
called wool, from whitch cloth iz sed to be made, and also from
whitch yarn iz sed to be spun.</p>

<p>There iz a grate deal ov yarn spun in this world that has
no wool in it; theze yarns are called phibs.</p>

<span id="pg_55" class="page_anchor">55 </span>

<p>Phibs are not konsidered feroshus. A phib iz a lie painted
in water kullers.</p>

<p>Thare haz been more phibs in market since the formashun

<p>Phibs are often ingenious, sometimes quite pretty, but are
alwus dangerous.</p>

<p>Phibs are sumtimes a grate deal more plauzable than truth.</p>

<p>Look out for them.</p>

<p>Phibbers hav been known tew bekum liars, just az hot lemonade

<h2 id="sec-18">THE DUV.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> duv iz the lam amung birds.</p>

<p>They are az harmless az a dandy lion.</p>

<p>They don’t do enny hard work, but eat oats and bill and
coo.</p>

<p>They luv each other like a nu married kupple.</p>

<p>The duv alwus hav a good appetight; they will eat from
dalite tew dark and seem tew be sorry they didn’t eat sum
more.</p>

<p>They are a long lived burd, and like the bumble bee, are the
biggest when they are born.</p>

<p>I never knu a duv tew la down, and di ov old age.</p>

<p>They are very thrifty, they will inkrease phaster than the
multiplikashun table.</p>

<p>They are like the meazles, if yu hav them at all, yu hav
got tew hav a good menny ov them.</p>

<p>The duv haz existed a long time, and was one ov Noahs
pets, when he sailed.</p>

<p>The fust duv he sent out ov the ark brought bak an olive
<span id="pg_56" class="page_anchor">56 </span>
branch, and the next time he sent her out, she didn’t bring
bak enny thing.</p>

<p>She even forgot tew cum bak herself.</p>

<p>Noah had but one pair ov each breed ov duvs in the ark,
and the one he sent out, and the one he had on hand, must
hav found each other, this explains the lov, and effekshun, ov
the duv.</p>

<p>The duv iz more ornamental than useful.</p>

<p>They are too inosent tew be very useful.</p>

<p>Sumtimes too mutch inosense interferes with bizzness.</p>

<p>I hav known half a dozen duvs tew git into a pie together,
and make themselves useful for a fu minnitts.</p>

<p>I don’t hate duv pies.</p>

<p>The duv hav alwuss been a kard tew define inosense.</p>

<p>The bible tells us, “to be az wize az a sarpent, <i>but harmless</i>
as a duv.”</p>

<p>This iz fust rate advice, but it means live bizzness.</p>

<p>Enny boddy who iz az wise az a sarpent, kan afford tew be
az harmless az a duv.</p>

<p>The rite mixtur ov duv and sarpient in a man’s natur iz a
good dose.</p>

<p>If a man haz got too much snaik in him, he iz liable tew
overdo things, and if he haz got too mutch duv in him, he
aint apt tew cook things enuff.</p>

<p>The duv iz a homemade kritter; they are as effeckshionate
as a cockroach iz.</p>

<p>The nearer they kan liv tew whare man duz, the more they
are apt tew do it.</p>

<p>Lams and duvs hav a grate menny weak points; but i
wouldn’t like enny better phun than tew liv whar thare want
ennything else but duvs and lams. But this place aint laid
down on enny of the maps in this world.</p>

<p>Hawks and wolfs hav made the duv and lam trade dredful
unsartin.</p>

<p>I guess, after all, that the evil things in this life help tew
make the good things more desirable, and all things that are
natral must be right, be they lam, duv, wolf or sarpient.</p>

<p>The best way to ketch a flirt iz to travel the other way
from which they are going, or set down on the grass and
whissell sum lively tune till the flirt cums round.</p>

<p>Old bachelors make the flirts, and then the flirts git more
than even, by making the old bachelors.</p>

<p>A majority ov the flirts get married finally, for they have
a grate quantity ov the most dainty titbits ov woman’s natur,
and alwus hav shrewdness tew back up their sweetness.</p>

<p>Flirts don’t deal in poetry and water grewel; they hav got
tew hav brains, or else sumboddy would trade them out ov
their capital at the fust swop.</p>

<p>Thare iz sich a thing (i hav bin told bi thoze who know sum
more ov theze things than i do,) az old bachelors being manufackterd
out ov dissapointed love.</p>

<p>This iz a good deal az sensible, az a man’s staying put in
<span id="pg_58" class="page_anchor">58 </span>
the cold all night, on the wrong side ov a river, bekauze he
haz made up hiz mind tew ford it, in jist sich a place whare
he knows the water iz over hiz hed, when if he would go a
little further up or down the creek, he would find the crossing
easy, and a sweet little critter, with outstretched hands to
beckon him acrost.</p>

<p>Dissapointed luv must ov course be all on one side, and
this ain’t enny more excuse for being an old bachelor than
it iz for a man tew quit all kind ov manual labor, jist out ov
spite, and jine a poor house, bekauze he kant lift a ton at one
pop.</p>

<p>Old bachelors, others tell us, are made so bekauze they
fear the <i>burden</i> ov a family.</p>

<p>This would be a good excuse if there waz enny truth in it;
the fackt iz, if such men had a family, they would be the
grasshoppers themselfs that the bible speaks ov, as weighing
so mutch to the pound.</p>

<p>An old bachelor will brag about hiz freedum to you, hiz
relief from anxiety, hiz independance. This iz a dead beat
past ressurrection, for evryboddy knows there ain’t a more
anxious dupe on earth than he iz. All hiz dreams are charcole
sketches, ov boarding-school misses; he dresses, greases
hiz hair, paints hiz grizzly mustash, cultivates bunyons and
corns, tew pleese hiz captains, the wimmin, and only gits
laffed at for hiz pains.</p>

<p>I tried being an old bachelor till i waz about twenty years
old, and cum very near dieing a dozen times. I had more
sharp pain in one year than i have had since, put it all in a
heap; i waz in a lively fever all the time.</p>

<p>If a man haint got ennything in hiz natur but vanity and
self-love, he iz very apt tew want to be an old bachelor, and
generally makes a good specimen ov the critters; but what
more disgusting traits can a man have than these?—and thare
iz no stronger argument in favor ov gitting married than the
fackt that thare aint nothing that will kure theze komplaints
so thoroly az a wife and fifteen or twenty babes.</p>

<p>There iz only one person who haz inhabited this world thus
<span id="pg_59" class="page_anchor">59 </span>
far, that i think could hav bin an old bachelor and done the
subjekt justiss, and he waz Adam; but since Adam saw fit to
open the ball, i hold it iz every man’s duty to selekt a partner,
and keep the dance hot.</p>

<h2 id="sec-20">HORNS.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">I</span>n</span> writing the biographi ov <i>horns</i>, i am astonished tew
find so menny ov them, and so entirely different in their
pedigree and pretenshuns.</p>

<p>“<i>Cape Horn.</i>”—Cape Horn iz the biggest horn known to
man.</p>

<p>It iz a native ov the extreme bottom ov South Amerika,
and gores the oshun.</p>

<p>Cape Horn iz hollow, and akts az a phunnell for the winds,
which hurry thru it in mutch haste, cauzing the waters ov the
sea for a grate distance tew bekum crazy, which frightens
the vessells that go by thare, and makes them rare and pitch
tremenjus.</p>

<p>This horn iz like a sour old bull in the hiway, and dont
seem tew be ov enny use, only tew make folks go out ov
their way tew git round it.</p>

<p>“<i>Horn ov a dilemma.</i>”—Dilemma iz derived from the
siamese verb “<i>diloss</i>,” which means <i>a tite spot</i>, and haz a
horn on each end ov it.</p>

<p>Thare iz no choice in theze two horns; if yu seize one ov
them the other may perforate yu, and if yu dont take either
both of them may pitch into you.</p>

<p>I always avoid them if possible, but when possibility gives
out, mi rule iz tew shut up both eyes, and fite both prongs
with mi whole grit.</p>

<p>Nine times out ov ten this will smash a dilemma, and it iz
alwus a good fite if yu git licked the tenth.</p>

<p>Yu kant argy or reason with the horn ov a dilemma, the
only way iz tew advance in and fight for the gross amount.</p>

<p>“<i>Cow’s Horn.</i>”—Two bony projeckshuns, curved, crooked
<span id="pg_60" class="page_anchor">60 </span>
or strate, worn bi the cows on the apeks of their heds, for
ornament in times ov peace, and used when they go into war
tew stab with.</p>

<p>Theze horns are a kind ov family rechord.</p>

<p>At three years old a ring appears on the bottom ov the
horn next tew the hed, and each year after a fresh ring iz
born.</p>

<p>In this way the cows kno how old they are.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill-7">
<a href="images/ill-08.jpg"><img src="images/ill-08_min.jpg" alt=""></a>
<p class="caption">IN A HORN.</p>
</div>

<p>Sumtimes theze rings fill up the whole horn and grow off
onto the adjoining fences in the pasture lot, but this only
happens tew very old
cows.</p>

<p>I never knu it tew
happen in mi life, and
I dont think it ever
did, it iz one ov them
venerable lies that are
handed down from
father to son, just tew
keep the stock ov lies
from running out.</p>

<p>When I waz a boy
and had just begun
tew chew tobacco, i
waz told that butter
cum from the cow’s
horn—I hav since
found out that this iz
another cussed old lie.
This lieing tew children iz no evidence ov genius, and iz
sowing the seeds ov decepshun in a soil too apt bi nature tew
covet what aint undoubtedly so.</p>

<p>“<i>Dinner-Horn.</i>”—This is the oldest, and most sakred horn
thare iz. It iz set tew musik, and plays “Home, Sweet
Home” about noon. It has bin listened tew, with more
rapturous delite, than ever Graffula’s band haz. Yu kan
hear it further than yu kan one ov Mr. Rodman’s guns. It
<span id="pg_61" class="page_anchor">61 </span>
will arrest a man and bring him in quicker than a sheriff’s
warrent. It kan outfoot enny other noize. It kauzes the
deaf tew hear, and the dum tew shout for joy. Glorious old
instrument! long may yure lungs last!</p>

<p>“<i>Ram’s Horn.</i>”—A spiral root, that emerges suddenly
from the figure hed ov the maskuline sheep, and ramafies
untill it reaches a tip end. Ram’s horns are alwus a sure
sighn ov battle. They are used tew butt with, <i>but with</i> out
enny respekt to persons. They will attak a stun wall, or a
deakon or an established church. A story iz told ov old
deakon Fletcher ov Konnektikutt State, who waz digging post
holes in a ram pasture on hiz farm, and the moshun ov hiz
boddy waz looked upon, by the old ram, who fed in the lot,
az a banter for a fight.</p>

<p>Without arrangeing enny terms for the fight, the ram
went incontinently for the deakon, and took him, the fust
shot, on the blind side ov hiz boddy, jist about the meridian.</p>

<p>The blow transposed the deakon sum eighteen feet, with a
heels-over-hed moshun.</p>

<p>Exhasperated tew a point, at least ten foot beyond endurance,
the deakon jumped up, and skreamed his whole voice * * * “yu
darned—old cuss,” and then all at once remembering
that he waz a good, piuz deakon, he apologized by saying—“<i>that
iz, if I may be allowed the expresshun</i>.”</p>

<p>The deakon haz mi entire simpathy for the remarks made
tew the ram.</p>

<p>“<i>Whisky Horn.</i>”—This horn varys in length, but from
three to six inches iz the favorite size.</p>

<p>It iz different from other horns, being ov a fluid natur.</p>

<p>It iz really more pugnashus than the ram’s horn; six
inches ov it will knok a man perfekly calm.</p>

<p>When it knoks a man down it holds him thare.</p>

<p>It iz either the principal or the sekond in most all the
iniquity that iz travelling around.</p>

<p>It makes brutes of men, demons of wimmin and vagrants
of children.</p>

<p>It haz drawn more tears, broken more hearts and blited
<span id="pg_62" class="page_anchor">62 </span>
more hopes than all the other agencys of the devil put
together.</p>

<p>“<i>Horn Comb.</i>”—This simple little unsophistikated instrument
haz beheaded countless legions ov innocent children.</p>

<p>I don’t mean that it haz cut oph their heads, but that it
haz cut its way thru the hirsute embossing that adorns their
skalps.</p>

<p>It haz two rows of sharp teeth, and always haz a good
appetite.</p>

<p>It iz always az ready for a job az a village lawyer, and iz
az thorough az a sarch warrent.</p>

<p>It iz an emblem of faith and neatness.</p>

<p>When it gits old and looses its teeth it should be cherished,
hung up and labeled, “Well done old mouser.”</p>

<p>I always look upon an old and worn out horn tooth comb
with a species ov venerashun, bordering on melankolly. It
reminds me ov mi boyhood, <ins title="Note: “aud” in the original" id="cg_35">and</ins> the boyish things that waz
running through mi head in thoze days ov simplicity and
innocence.</p>

<p>Thare iz a grate menny other kinds ov horns, but I haint
got the time to tell yu all about them now. Thare iz the
“Powder Horn,” the “Horn ov the Bull Head,” and the
“Horn ov Plenty;” and there iz also “Horn Tooke,” a
celebrated writer ov hiz day; but good-by for the present.</p>

<h2 id="sec-21">KISSING.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">I</span> hav</span> written essays on kissing before this one, and they
didn’t satisfy me, nor dew I think this one will, for the
more a man undertakes tew tell about a kiss, the more he will
reduce his ignorance tew a science.</p>

<p>Yu kant analize a kiss enny more than yu kan the breath ov
a flower. Yu kant tell what makes a kiss taste so good enny
more than yu kan a peach.</p>

<p>Enny man who kan set down, whare it is cool, and tell how
<span id="pg_63" class="page_anchor">63 </span>
a kiss tastes, haint got enny more real flavor tew his mouth
than a knot hole haz. Such a phellow wouldn’t hesitate tew
deskribe Paridise as a fust rate place for gardin sass.</p>

<p>The only way tew diskribe a kiss is tew take one, and then
set down, awl alone, out ov the draft, and smack yure lips.</p>

<p>If yu kant satisfy yureself how a kiss tastes without taking
another one, how on arth kan you define it tew the next man.</p>

<p>I hav heard writers talk about the egstatick bliss thare waz
in a kiss, and they really seemed tew think they knew all about
it, but these are the same kind ov folks who perspire and kry
when they read poetry, and they fall to writing sum ov their
own, and think they hav found out how.</p>

<p>I want it understood that I am talking about pure emotional
kissing, that is born in the heart, and flies tew the lips, like a
humming bird tew her roost.</p>

<p>I am not talking about your lazy, milk and molasses kissing,
that daubs the face ov enny body, nor yure savage bite,
that goes around, like a roaring lion, in search ov sumthing
to eat.</p>

<p>Kissing an unwilling pair ov lips, iz az mean a viktory, az
robbin a bird’s nest, and kissing too willing ones iz about
az unfragant a recreation, az making boquets out ov dandelions.</p>

<p>The kind ov kissing that I am talking about iz the kind
that must do it, or spile.</p>

<p>If yu sarch the rekords ever so lively, yu kant find the author
ov the first kiss; kissing, like mutch other good things, iz
anonymous.</p>

<p>But thare iz such natur in it, sitch a world ov language
without words, sitch a heap ov pathos without fuss, so much
honey, and so little water, so cheap, so sudden, and so neat a
mode of striking up an acquaintance, that i consider it a good
purchase, that Adam giv, and got, the fust kiss.</p>

<p>Who kan imagin a grater lump ov earthly bliss, reduced tew
a finer thing, than kissing the only woman on earth, in the
garden of Eden.</p>

<p>Adam wan’t the man, i don’t beleave, tew pass sich a hand</p>

<span id="pg_64" class="page_anchor">64 </span>

<p>I may be wrong in mi konklusions, but if enny boddy kan
date kissing further back, i would like tew see them do it.</p>

<p>I don’t know whether the old stoick philosophers ever kist
enny boddy or not, if they did, they probably did it, like
drawing a theorem on a black board, more for the purpose of
proving sumthing else.</p>

<p>I do hate to see this delightful and invigorating beverage
adulturated, it iz nektar for the gods, i am often obliged tew
stand still, and see kissing did, and not say a word, that haint
got enny more novelty, nor meaning in it, than throwing
stones tew a mark.</p>

<p>I saw two maiden ladys kiss yesterday on the north side ov
Union square, 5 times in less than 10 minnitts; they kist every
time they bid each other farewell, and then immediately
thought ov sumthing else they hadn’t sed. I couldn’t tell for
the life ov me whether the kissing waz the effekt ov what
they sed, or what they sed waz the effekt ov the kissing. It
waz a which, and tother, scene.</p>

<p>Cross-matched kissing iz undoubtedly the strength ov the
game. It iz trew thare iz no stattu regulashun aginst two
females kissing each other; but i don’t think thare iz much
pardon for it, unless it iz done to keep tools in order; and
two men kissing each other iz prima face evidence ov deadbeatery.</p>

<p>Kissing that passes from parent to child, and back agin
seems to be az necessary az shinplasters, to do bizzness with;
and kissing that hussbands give and take iz simply gathering
ripe fruit from ones own plumb tree, that would otherwise
drop oph, or be stolen.</p>

<p>Tharefore i am driv tew konklude, tew git out ov the corner
that mi remarks hav chased me into, that the ile ov a kiss iz
only tew be had once in a phellow’s life, in the original package,
and that iz when....</p>

<p>Not tew waste the time ov the reader, i hav thought best
not tew finish the abuv sentence, hoping that their aint no
person ov a good edukashun, and decent memory, but what
kan reckolekt the time which i refer to, without enny ov mi
help.</p>

<h2 id="sec-22">“WHAT I KNO ABOUT PHARMING.”</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">W</span>hat</span> i kno about pharmin, iz kussid little.</p>

<p>Mi buzzum friend, Horace Greely, haz rit a book with
the abuv name, and altho i haven’t had time tew peerose it
yet, i don’t hesitate tew pronounse it bully.</p>

<p>Pharmin, (now daze) iz pretty much all theory, and tharefore
it aint astonishing, that a man kan live in New York,
and be a good chancery lawyer, and also kno all about pharming.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill-8">
<a href="images/ill-09.jpg"><img src="images/ill-09_min.jpg" alt=""></a>
<p class="caption">BLOWING.</p>
</div>

<p>A pharm, (now daze) ov one hundred akers, will produse
more bukwheat, and
pumkins, run on theory,
than it would 60
years ago, run with
manure, and hard
knoks.</p>

<p>Thare iz nothing like
book larning, and the
time will evventually
cum, when a man,
won’t hav tew hav only
one ov “<i>Josh Billing’s
Farmers’ Allmanax</i>,”
to run a farm, or a
kamp meeting with.</p>

<p>Even now it aint
unkommon, tew see
three, or four, hired
men, on a farm, with
three, or four, spans ov
oxen, all standing still, while the boss goes into the library,
and reads himself up for the days’ ploughing.</p>

<p>If i was running a pharm, (now daze) i suppoze i would
rather hav 36 bushels, ov sum nu breed ov potatoze, raized
on theory, than tew hav 84 bushels, got in the mean, benighted,
and underhanded way, ov our late lamented grand parents.</p>

<span id="pg_66" class="page_anchor">66 </span>

<p>Pharmin, after all, iz a good deal like the tavern bizzness,
ennyboddy thinks they kan keep a hotel, (now daze,) <i>and
they kan</i>, but this iz the way that poor hotels cum tew be so
plenty, and this iz likewize what makes pharmin such eazy,
and proffitable bizzness.</p>

<p>Just take the theory out ov pharming, and thare aint nothing
left, but hard work, and all fired lite krops.</p>

<p>When i see so mutch pholks, rushing into theory pharming,
az thare iz, (now daze) and so menny ov them rushing out
agin, i think ov that remarkable piece ov skriptur, which
remarks, “menny are called, but few are chosen.”</p>

<p>I onst took a pharm, on shares miself, and run her on sum
theorys, and the thing figured up this way, i dun all the work,
I furnished all the seed, and manure, had the ague 9 months,
out of 12, for mi share ov the proffits, and the other phellow,
paid the taxes on the pharm, for hiz share.</p>

<p>By mutual konsent, i quit the farm, at the end of the
year.</p>

<p>What i kno about pharmin, aint wuth bragging about, and
i feel it mi duty to state, for the benefit ov mi kreditors, that
if they ever expekt me tew pay 5 cents on a dollar, they musn’t
start me in the theoretikal pharmin employ.</p>

<p>If a man really iz anxious tew make munny on a pharm,
the less theory he lays in the better, and he must do pretty
mutch all the work hisself, and support hiz family on what
he kant sell, and go ragged enuff all the time tew hunt bees.</p>

<p>I kno ov menny farmers, who are so afflikted with superstishun,
that they wont plant a single bean, only in the last
quarter of the moon, and i kno ov others so pregnant with
science, that they wont set a gate post, until they hav had
the ground analized, bi sum professor ov anatomy, tew see
if the earth haz got the right kind of ingredience for post-holes.</p>

<p>This iz what i call running science into the ground.</p>

<p>The fakt ov it iz, that theorys, ov all kind, work well,
except in praktiss: they are too often designed tew do the
work ov praktiss.</p>

<span id="pg_67" class="page_anchor">67 </span>

<p>Thare aint no theory in brakeing a mule, only tew go at
him, with a klub in yure hand, and sum blood in yure eye,
and brake him, just as yu would split a log.</p>

<p>What i kno about pharming, aint wuth mutch enny how,
but I undertook teu brake a kicking heifer once.</p>

<p>I read a treatiss on the subjekt, and phollowed the direkshuns
cluss, and got knokt endwaze, in about 5 minnits.</p>

<p>I then sot down, and thought the thing over.</p>

<p>I made up mi mind that the phellow who wrote the treatiss
waz more in the treatiss bizzness than he waz in the kicking
heifer trade.</p>

<p>I cum tew the konklushun that what he knu about milking
kiking heifers, he had larnt by leaning over a barn yard fence,
and writing the thing up.</p>

<p>I got up from my reflekshuns strengthened, and went for
that heifer.</p>

<p>I will draw a veil over the language i used, and the things
i did, but i went in to win, <i>and won</i>.</p>

<p>That heifer never bekum a cow.</p>

<p>This iz one way tew brake a kicking heifer, and after a man
haz studdyed all the books in kreashun on the subjek, and
tried them on, he will fall back onto mi plan, and make up
hiz mind, az i did, that a kicking heifer iz wuth more for beef
than she iz for theoretick milk.</p>

<p>I hav worked on a pharm just long enuff tew kno that
thare iz no prayers so good for poor land az manure, and no
theory kan beat twelve hours each day, (sundaze excepted) of
honest labour applied tew the sile.</p>

<p>I am an old phashioned phellow, and hartily hate most nu
things, bekauze i hav bin beat bi them so often.</p>

<p>I never knu a pharm that waz worked pretty mutch by theory,
but what waz for sale, or to let, in a fu years, and i never
knu a pharm that waz worked by manure, and muscle, on the
good old ignorant way ov our ansestors, but what waz handed
down, from father to son, and alwus waz noted for razing
brawny armed boys, and buxom lasses, and fust rate potatoze.</p>

<p>What i kno about pharmin, iz nothing but experiense, and
experiense, (now daze,) aint wuth a kuss.</p>

<span id="pg_68" class="page_anchor">68 </span>

<p>I had rather hav a good looking theory, tew ketch flats with,
than the experiense—even ov Methuseler.</p>

<p>Experiense iz a good thing tew lay down and die with, but
yu kant do no big bizzness with it, (now daze,) it aint hot enuff.</p>

<p>Giv me a red hot humbug, and i kan make most ov the
experiense, in this world ashamed ov itself.</p>

<h2 id="sec-23">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">Q</span>u.</span>—Did you ever see an old horce, holler-eyed and bony,
limp-legged and pur-blind, kivvered with a gold-plated
harniss and waited upon by a spruce postillion, and a liveryed
coachman?</p>

<p>Ans.—Yes i hav, and i hav seen old age put on pomposity,
hobble in brocade, command reverance, exult with pride and
grin with pain, and i hav sed tew myself “poor old hoss.”</p>

<p>Qu.—Did yu ever hear phools, and even wise men say
that life waz short, that deth waz certain, that happiness waz
skase?</p>

<p>Ans.—I have herd theze remarks quite often, but i never
herd a bizzy man find enny fault with the length of life, nor
a pure one regret that deth waz a sure thing, nor a vartuous
one konplain about the high price of happiness.</p>

<p>Qu.—Did you ever hear an old maid prattle about the
falsity ov man, the grate risk thare waz in having one, the
bliss thare waz in being boss ov one’s self?</p>

<p>Ans.—It seems tew me that i hav, and i have alwus felt az
tho the old virgin waz taking medicine awl the time she was
saying it.</p>

<p>Qu.—Iz thare enny vacancy at present for a man in polite
sirkles, who didn’t hav a ritch daddy, or who hadn’t bored
suckcessfully for ile himself?</p>

<p>Ans.—If we hear ov enny sutch opening we will telegraff
yu at once, but jist now, the way things are run, a man with
seedy garments on would even git kicked out ov a fust klass
meeting house, and be put under 10 thousand dollar bonds
<span id="pg_69" class="page_anchor">69 </span>
tew keep the peace. Our advice tew a poor, but virtewous
individual, would be tew take hiz virtew under hiz arm, keep
shady, and let the polite sirkles chew each other.</p>

<p>Qu.—Kan a young man without enny mustash git a situation
in Nu York Sitty?</p>

<p>Ans.—Yes, but it would probably be in the station-house.
Yung men without enny mustash are looked upon with suspicion,
and yu will find, if yu put them under oath, that they
either haint got ennything but common sense, or they are
too stingy to buy a bottle ov “Bolivards’s oil ov seduktion,”
warrented tew fetch hair, or tare oph the lip.</p>

<p>Qu.—Kan yu inform me the best way that haz yet been
invented yet to bring up a boy?</p>

<p>Ans.—Giv me 10 dollars and i will tell you. But here is
a recipee that i giv away. Bring up your boy in fear ov the
rod and a gin mill.</p>

<p>Qu.—Iz thare enny kure for natral laziness, whare it iz a
part ov a man’s constitushun and bye laws?</p>

<p>Ans.—Only one kure, that iz, milk a cow on the run, and
subsist on the milk.</p>

<p>Qu.—How fast duz sound travel?</p>

<p>Ans.—This depends a good deal upon the natur ov the
noize yu are talking about. The sound ov a dinner horn for
instance travels a half a mile in a seckond, while an invitashun
tew git up in the morning I hav known to be 3 quarters
ov an hour going up two pair ov stairs, and then not hav
strength enuff left tew be heard.</p>

iz az hard for me tew say, az mi prayers in lo dutch.</p>

<p class="caption">WHISSLING.</p>
</div>

<p>Whissling iz a wind
instrument, and iz did
bi puckring up the
mouth, and blowing
through the hole.</p>

<p>Thare aint no tune
on the whole earth
but what kan be
played on this instrument,
and that selebrated
old tune,
Yankeedoodle haz bin
almost whissled tew
deth.</p>

<p>Grate thinkers are
not apt tew be good
whisslers, in fakt,
when a man kant
think ov nothing,
then he begins tew whissell. We seldom see a raskal who iz
a good whissler, thare iz a grate deal ov honor bright, in a
sharp, well puckered whissell.</p>

<p>Good whisslers are gitting skarse, 75 years ago they waz
plenty, but the desire tew git ritch, or tew hold offiss, haz
took the pucker out ov this honest, and cheerful amuzement.</p>

<p>If i had a boy, who couldn’t whissell, i don’t want tew be
understood, that i should feel at liberty, tew giv the boy up
for lost, but i would mutch rather he would kno how tew
whissell fust rate, than to kno how tew play a seckond rate
game ov kards.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t force a boy ov mine tew whissell agin his natral
inclinashun.</p>

<p>Wimmin az a kind, or in the lump, are poor whizzlers, i
don’t kno how i found this out, but i am glad ov it, it iz a
good deal like crowing in a hen.</p>

<span id="pg_71" class="page_anchor">71 </span>

<p>Crowing iz an unladylike thing in a hen tew do.</p>

<p>I hav often heard hens tri tew cro, but i never knu one tew
do herself justiss.</p>

<p>A rooster kan krow well, and a hen kan kluk well, and i sa
let each one ov them stik tew their trade.</p>

<p>Klucking iz jist az necessary in this wurld az crowing espeshily
if it iz well did.</p>

<p>But i want it well understood that i am the last man on
reckord who would refuse a woman a chance tew whissell if
she waz certain she had the right pucker for it.</p>

<p>I never knu a good whissler but what had a good constitushun.
Whissling iz compozed ov pucker and wind, and these
two accomplishments denote vigor.</p>

<p>Sum people alwus whissell whare thare iz danger—this they
do to keep the fraid out ov them. When i waz a boy i alwus
konsidered whissling the next best thing to a kandle to go
down cellar with in the nite time.</p>

<p>The best whisslers i hav ever heard hav bin amung the negroes
(i make this remark with the highest respekt to the accomplishments
ov the whites), i hav herd a south karoliny
darkey whissell so natral that a mocking-bird would drop a
worm out ov hiz bill and talk back to the nigger.</p>

<p>I dont want enny better evidence ov the general honesty
thare iz in a whissell than the fackt that thare aint nothing
which a dog will answer quicker than the wissell ov hiz master,
and dogs are az good judges ov honesty az enny kritters
that live.</p>

<p>It iz hard work to phool a dog once, and it iz next to impossible
to phool him the sekond time.</p>

<p>I aint afraid to trust enny man for a small amount who iz a
good whissler.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t want to sell him a farm on credit, for i should
expekt to hav to take the farm back after awhile and remove
the mortgage miself.</p>

<p>Yu cant whissell a mortgage oph from a farm.</p>

<p>A fust rate whissler iz like a middling sized fiddler, good
for nothing else, and tho whissling may keep a man from gitting
lonesum, it wont keep him from gitting ragged.</p>

<span id="pg_72" class="page_anchor">72 </span>

<p>I never knu a bee hunter but what waz a good whissler,
and i dont kno ov enny bizzness on the breast ov the earth
that will make a man so lazy and useless, without acktually
killing him, az hunting bees in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Hunting bees and writing seckond rate verses are evidences
ov sum genius, but either of them will unfit a man for doing
a good square day’s work.</p>

<h2 id="sec-25">HOTELS.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">H</span>otels</span> are houses ov refuge, homes for the vagrants, the
married man’s retreat, and the bachelor’s fireside.</p>

<p>They are kept in all sorts ov ways, sum on the European
plan, and menny ov them on no plan at all.</p>

<p>A good landlord iz like a good stepmother, he knows hiz
bizzness and means to do hiz duty.</p>

<p>He knows how to rub hiz hands with joy when the traveler
draws nigh, he knows how to smile, he knew yure wife’s
father when he waz living, and yure wife’s fust husband, but
he don’t speak about him.</p>

<p>He kan tell whether it will rain to-morrow or not, he hears
yure komplaints with a tear in hiz eye, he blows up the servants
at yure suggestion, and stands around reddy, with a
shirt collar az stiff az broken china.</p>

<p>A man may be a good supream court judge and at the same
time be a miserable landlord.</p>

<p>Most evrybody thinks they kan keep a hotel (and they kan),
but this ackounts for the grate number ov hotels that are kept
on the same principle that a justiss ov the peace offiss iz kept
in the country during a six-days’ jury trial for killing sumboddy’s
yello dorg.</p>

<p>A hotel wont keep itself and keep the landlord too, and
ever kure a traveler from the habit ov profane swareing.</p>

<p>I hav had this experiment tried on me several times, and it
alwus makes the swares, wuss.</p>

<span id="pg_73" class="page_anchor">73 </span>

<p>It iz too often the kase that landlords go into the bizzness
ov hash az ministers go into the professhun, with the very best
ov motives, but the poorest kind ov prospecks.</p>

<p>I dont know ov enny bizzness more flattersum than the
tavern bizzness, there dont seem to be ennything to do but
to stand in front ov the register with a pen behind the ear and
see that the guests enter themselfs az soon az they enter the
house, then yank a bell-rope six or seven times, and then tell
John to sho the gentleman to 976, and then take four dollars
and fifty cents next morning from the poor devil ov a traveler
and let him went.</p>

<p>This seems to be the whole thing (and it iz the whole thing)
in most cases.</p>

<hr>

<p>Yu will diskover the following deskripshun a mild one, ov
about 9 hotels out ov 10 between the Atlantik and Pacifick
Oshuns akrost the United States in a straight line:</p>

<p>Yure room iz 13 foot 6 inches, by 9 foot 7 inches, parallelogramly.</p>

<p>It being court week (az usual), all the good rooms are employed
bi the lawyers and judges.</p>

<p>Yure room iz on the uttermost floor.</p>

<p>The carpet iz ingrain—ingrained with the dust, kerosene
ile, and ink-spots ov four generashuns.</p>

<p>Thare iz two pegs in the room tew hitch coats onto, one ov
them broke oph, and the other pulled out, and missing.</p>

<p>The buro haz three legs, and one brick.</p>

<p>The glass to the buro swings on two pivots, which hav lost
their grip.</p>

<p>Thare iz one towel on the rack, thin, but wet. The rain
water in the pitcher cum out ov the well.</p>

<p>The soap iz az tuff tew wear az a whetstone.</p>

<p>The soap iz scented with cinnamon ile, and variagated with
spots.</p>

<p>Thare iz three chairs, kane setters, one iz a rocker, and all
three are busted.</p>

<p>Thare iz a match-box, empty.</p>

<span id="pg_74" class="page_anchor">74 </span>

<p>Thare iz no kurtin to the windo, and thare don’t want to
be any, yu kant see out, and who kan see in?</p>

<p>The bel rope iz cum oph about 6 inches this side ov the
ceiling.</p>

<p>The bed iz a modern slat bottom, with two mattrasses, one
cotton, and one husk, and both harder, and about az thick az
a sea biskitt.</p>

<p>Yu enter the bed sideways and kan feel evry slat at once
az eazy az yu could the ribs ov a grid iron.</p>

<p>The bed iz inhabited.</p>

<p>Yu sleep sum, but rool over a good deal.</p>

<p>For breakfast you have a gong, and rhy coffee too kold to
melt butter, fride potatoze which resemble the chips a two
inch auger makes in its journey through an oak log.</p>

<p>Bread solid, beef stake about az thik az a blister plaster, and
so tuff az a hound’s ear.</p>

<p>Table covered with plates, a few scared to death pickles on
one ov them, and 6 fly endorsed crackers on another.</p>

<p>A pewterinktom caster with three bottles in it, one without
enny pepper in it, one without enny mustard, and one
with two inches ov drowned flies, and vinegar in it.</p>

<p>Servant gall, with hoops on, hangs around you earnestly,
and wants to know if yu will take another cup ov coffee.</p>

<p>Yu say “<i>No mom, i thank yu</i>,” and push back yure chair.</p>

<p>Yu haven’t eat enuff tew pay for picking yure teeth.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am about az selfconsaited az it will do for a man to be
and not crack open, but i never yet consaited that i could
keep a hotel, i had rather be a hiwayman than to be sum
landlords i have visited with.</p>

<p>Thare are hotels that are a joy upon earth, where a man
pays hiz bill az cheerfully az he did the parson who married
him, whare yu kant find the landlord unless yu hunt in the
kitchen, whare servants glide around like angels ov mercy,
whare the beds fit a man’s back like the feathers on a goose,
and whare the vittles taste just az tho yure wife, or yure
mother had fried them.</p>

<span id="pg_75" class="page_anchor">75 </span>

<p>Theze kind ov hotels ought tew be bilt on wheels and travel
around the country; they are az phull ov real cumfort az a
thanksgiving pudding, but alass! yes, alass! they are az unplenty
az double-yelked eggs.</p>

commandments.</p>

<p>Philosophikally konsidered, it beats Herrick’s pills 3 pills
in the game.</p>

<p>Theoretikally konsidered, it kan out-argy all the logik in
existence.</p>

<p>Analitikally konsidered, enny part ov it iz equal tew the
whole.</p>

<p>Konstitushionally konsidered, it iz vittles and sumthing
tew drink.</p>

<p>Multifariously konsidered, it iz just az different from ennything
else az it is from itself.</p>

<p>Phumatically konsidered, it haz a good deal ov essence and
sum boddy.</p>

<p>Pyroteknikally konsidered, it is the fire-works of the soul.</p>

<p>Syllogestikally konsidered, the konklushuns allwus follows

<p>Phosphorescently konsidered, it lights up like a globe
lantern.</p>

<p>Exsudashiously konsidered, it haz all the dissolving propertys

<p>But this iz too big talk for me; theze flatulent words waz

use who hav tew load a kannon klean up tew the muzzell
with powder and ball when they go out tew hunt pissmires.</p>

<p>But i don’t intend this essa for laffing in the lump, but for
laffing on the half-shell.</p>

<p><ins title="Note: “Laffiing” in the original" id="cg_36">Laffing</ins> iz just az natral tew cum tew the surface as a rat
iz tew cum out ov hiz hole when he wants tew.</p>

<p>Yu kant keep it back by swallowing enny more than yu
kan the heekups.</p>

<p>If a man <i>kan’t</i> laff there iz sum mistake made in putting
him together, and if he <i>won’t</i> laff he wants az mutch keeping
away from az a bear-trap when it iz sot.</p>

<p>I have seen people who laffed altogether too mutch for
their own good or for ennyboddy else’s; they laft like a barrell
ov nu sider with the tap pulled out, a perfekt stream.</p>

<p>This is a grate waste ov natral juice.</p>

<p>I have seen other people who didn’t laff enuff tew giv
themselfs vent; they waz like a barrell ov nu sider too, that
waz bunged up tite, apt tew start a hoop and leak all away
on the sly.</p>

<p>Thare ain’t neither ov theze 2 ways right, and they never
ought tew be pattented.</p>

<p>Sum pholks hav got what iz kalled a hoss-laff, about haffway
between a growl and a bellow, just az a hoss duz when
he feels hiz oats, and don’t exackly kno what ails him.</p>

<p>Theze pholks don’t enjoy a laff enny more than the man
duz hiz vettles who swallows hiz pertatoze whole.</p>

<p>A laff tew be nourishsome wants tew be well chewed.</p>

<p>Thare iz another kind ov a laff which i never did enjoy,
one loud busst, and then everything iz az still az a lager beer
barrell after it haz blowed up and slung 2 or 3 gallons ov
beer around loose.</p>

<p>Thare iz another laff whitch I hav annalized; it cums out
ov the mouth with a noize like a pig makes when he iz
in a tite spot, one sharp squeal and two snikkers, and then
dies in a simper.</p>

<p>This kind ov a laff iz larnt at femail boarding-skools, and
<span id="pg_77" class="page_anchor">77 </span>
dont mean ennything; it iz nothing more than the skin ov a
laff.</p>

<p>Genuine laffing iz the vent ov the soul, the nostrils ov the
heart, and iz jist az necessary for helth and happiness as
spring water iz for a trout.</p>

<p>Thare iz one kind ov a laff that i always did reckommend;
it looks out ov the eye fust with a merry twinkle, then it
kreeps down on its hands and kneze and plays around the
mouth like a pretty moth around the blaze ov a kandle, then
it steals over into the dimples ov the cheeks and rides around
in thoze little whirlpools for a while, then it lites up the
whole face like the mello bloom on a damask roze, then it
swims oph on the air, with a peal az klear and az happy az a
dinner-bell, then it goes bak agin on golden tiptoze like an
angel out for an airing, and laze down on its little bed ov
violets in the heart whare it cum from.</p>

<p>Thare iz another laff that noboddy kan withstand; it iz
just az honest and noizy az a distrikt skool let out tew play,
it shakes a man up from hiz toze tew hiz temples, it dubbles
and twists him like a whiskee phit, it lifts him up oph from
hiz cheer, like feathers, and lets him bak agin like melted led,
it goes all thru him like a pikpocket, and finally leaves him
az weak and az krazy az tho he had bin soaking all day in a
Rushing bath and forgot tew be took out.</p>

<p>This kind ov a laff belongs tew jolly good phellows who
are az helthy az quakers, and who are az eazy tew pleaze az
a gall who iz going tew be married to-morrow.</p>

<p>In konclushion i say laff every good chance yu kan git, but
don’t laff unless yu feal like it, for there ain’t nothing in this
world more harty than a good honest laff, nor nothing more
hollow than a hartless one.</p>

<p>When yu do laff open yure mouth wide enuff for the noize
tew git out without squealing, thro yure hed bak az tho yu
waz going tew be shaved, hold on tew yure false hair with
both hands and then laff till yure soul gets thoroly rested.</p>

<p><span class="first_word" title="Note: Normal text in the original"><span class="cap">T</span>here</span> is nothing that haz bin diskovered yet, that iz so
skarse as good Hoss sense, about 28 hoss power.</p>

<p>I don’t mean race hoss, nor trotting hoss sense, that kan
run a mile in 1:28
and then brake
down; nor trot in
2:13, and good for
nothing afterwards,
only to brag on; but
I mean the all-day
hoss sense, that iz
good for 8 miles an
hour, from rooster
crowing in the morning,
until the cows
cum home at night,
klean tew the end
ov the road.</p>

<p>I hav seen fast
sense, that was like
sum hoses, who
could git so far in
one day that it would
take them two days tew git back, on a litter. I don’t mean
this kind nuther.</p>

<p>Good hard-pan sense iz the thing that will wash well, wear
well, iron out without wrinkling, and take starch without
kracking.</p>

<p>Menny people are hunting after uncommon sense, but they
never find it a good deal; uncommon sense iz ov the nature of
genius, and all genius iz the gift of God, and kant be had,
like hens eggs, for the hunting.</p>

<p>Good, old-fashioned common sense iz one ov the hardest
things in the world to out-wit, out-argy, or beat in enny way,
it iz az honest az a loaf ov good domestik bread, alwus in tune,
either hot from the oven or 8 days old.</p>

<span id="pg_79" class="page_anchor">79 </span>

<p>Common sense kan be improved upon by edukashun—genius
kan be too, sum, but not much.</p>

<p>Edukashun gauls genius like a bad setting harness.</p>

<p>Common sense iz like biled vittles, it is good right from the
pot, and it is good nex day warmed up.</p>

<p>If every man waz a genius, mankind would be az bad oph
az the heavens would be, with every star a comet, things would
git hurt badly, and noboddy tew blame.</p>

<p>Common sense iz instinkt, and instinkt don’t make enny
blunders mutch, no more than a rat duz, in coming out, or
going intew a hole, he hits the hole the fust time, and just fills it.</p>

<p>Genius iz always in advance ov the times, and makes sum
magnificent hits, but the world owes most ov its tributes to
good hoss sense.</p>

<p>Everyboddy wants tew be heard fust, and this iz jist what
fills the world with nonsense.</p>

<p>Everyboddy wants tew talk, few want to think, and noboddy
wants tew listen.</p>

<p>The greatest talkers amung the feathered folks, are the
magpie and ginny hen, and neither ov them are ov mutch
account.</p>

<p>If a man ain’t sure he iz right the best kard he kan play iz
a blank one.</p>

<p>I have known menny a man tew beat in an argument by
just nodding his hed once in a while and simply say, “<i>jess so,
jess so</i>.”</p>

<p>It takes a grate menny blows tew drive in a nail, but one
will clinch it.</p>

<p>Sum men talk just az a French pony trots, all day long, in
a haff bushel meazzure.</p>

<span id="pg_80" class="page_anchor">80 </span>

<p>Silence never makes enny blunders, and alwus gits az mutch
credit az iz due it, and oftimes more.</p>

on mi boots.</p>

<p>I hav bin tew church hungry for sum gospel, and cum hum
so phull ov it that i couldn’t draw a long breth without starting
a button.</p>

<p>Brevity and silence are the two grate kards, and next to saying
nothing, saying a little, iz the strength ov the game.</p>

<p>One thing iz certain, it iz only the grate thinkers who kan
afford tew be brief, and thare haz bin but phew volumes yet
published which could not be cut down two-thirds, and menny
ov them could be cut klean back tew the title page without
hurting them.</p>

<p>Iz hard tew find a man ov good sense who kan look back
upon enny occason and wish he had sed sum more, but it iz
eazy tew find menny who wish they had said less.</p>

<p>A thing sed iz hard tew recall, but unsed it kan be spoken

<p>It iz not bravery to face what we kan’t dodge, but it iz
true courage tew face all things that are honest and dodge
nothing.</p>

<p>True bravery exists amung the lowly just az mutch az amung
the grate, and a man really haz no more right tew expekt
praise for his courage than he haz for hiz virtue.</p>

<p>It often requires more bravery tew tell the simple truth than
it duz tew win a battle.</p>

<p>He who fills to the brim the stashun in life, which nature
or fortune haz given him, iz a hero; i don’t kare whether he
iz a peasant on the hillside, or chieftian in the tented field.</p>

<p>The most sublime courage I hav ever witnessed, hav been
among that klass who waz too poor to know that they possessed
it, and too humble for the world ever to diskover it.</p>

<p>When I want to see a hero, or commune with one, i don’t
go tew the pages ov history; i kan find them in among the
bipaths ov every day life, i hav known them tew liv out

<p>After going about haff a mile, take your fust left hand
road, and when yu cum tew a bridge, cross it, and go thru a
pair ov bars on the right, walk about two hundred yards in a
south-east direckshun, and yu will cum suddenly on a watermellon
patch.</p>

<p>Pik out a good, dark-colored one, with the skin a leetle
ruffish; be kareful not to injure enny ov the vines by stepping
on them; shoulder the watermellon, and retrace yure
steps, walking about twice az fast az yu did when yu cum
out.</p>

<p>Once in a while look over yure shoulder too see if the
moon is all right. When yu reach hum, bury the watermellon
in the ha mow and slip into bed, just as tho nothing
had happened.</p>

<p>This is an old-fashioned, time-honored way, tew pik out
a good watermellon, just the way our fathers and grandfathers
did it.</p>

<p>After yu hav et the watermellon tare up the resipee.</p>

<p>I am not anxious tew hav this resipee preserved, but i dont

<p>One watermellon during yure life is enuff to pik out in this

<p>Dont do it but jist once, and then be kind ov sorry for it

<p>Menny people will wonder and worry whare the moral

venture to say that thare aint a prominent moralist in Amerika

the spirit ov adventure that promted the undertaking,

<h2 id="sec-33">HOW TEW PIK OUT A DOG.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">D</span>ogs</span> are gitting dredful skase, and if yu dont pik one
out putty soon, it will be forever too late.</p>

<span id="pg_85" class="page_anchor">85 </span>

<p>I hav written during my yunger days, when I knu a good
deal more than i do now, or ever shal kno agin, an essa onto
dogs, and in that essa i klaimed that the best kind ov a dog
for all purposes for a man tew hav was a wodden dog.</p>

<p>The experience ov years don’t seem tew change mi opinyun,
and i now, az then, reckomend the wodden dog.</p>

<p>Dogs, az a genral thing, are ornamental, and the wodden
dog kan be made hily so, after enny pattern or desighn that
a kultivated taste may suggest.</p>

<p>If the wodden dog iz made with the bark on, so mutch the
better; for we are told bi thoze who studdy sich things that
dogs which bark never bight.</p>

<p>Wodden dogs never stra away three or four times a year,
like flesh and blood dogs do, and don’t kost 5 or 10 dollars
reward each time tew make them cam bak hum agin.</p>

<p>Wodden dogs don’t hav the old hydrophobiskiousness;
neither are they running round, and round, and round, and
round after them selfs, trieing tew ketch up with a wicked flea,
who iz bizzily engaged knawing away at the dog’s—continuashun.</p>

<p>Thare ain’t no better watch dog in the world than the
wodden one. Yu set them tew watching enny thing, they
will watch it for 3 years, and they aint krazy, and want tew
jump thru a window in a minnit, if they just happen tew
hear a boy out in the streets whissling “<i>Yankee Doodle</i>” or
“<i>Sally Cum Up</i>.”</p>

<p>Wodden dogs won’t stretch themselfs out in front ov the
fire place, taking up all the hot room, nor they won’t fly at a
harmless old beggar man, who only wants a krust, and tare
him all tew little bits in a minnitt.</p>

<p>If yu want tew pik out a good dog, pik out a wodden one,
they range in price, all the way from 10 cents tew a dollar
ackording tew the lumber in them, old age don’t make them
kross and useless, and if they do happen tew loze, a hed, or a
leg, in sum skrimmage, a dose ov Spaldings glu, taken at
night, jist before they retire will fetch them out all strait, in
the morning.</p>

<p>To pik out a good kat, one that will tend tew bizzness and
not astronomize nights, nor praktiss operatik strains, iz an
evidence ov genius.</p>

<p>I don’t luv kats enuff tew pik one out enny how, but i have
picked a kitten out ov a swill barrel before now with a pair
of tongs, just tew save life.</p>

<p>Color iz no kriterion ov kats, i hav seen dredful mean kats

stove all day, and be stepped on their tail, every fu minnitts.</p>

<p>“<i>Pumpkin Pi.</i>”—This delitesum work ov art <i>iz</i>, (or rather
<i>was</i>) a triumphant conglomerashun ov baked doe, and biled
pumpkin.</p>

<p>It waz diskovered during the old ov the moon, in the year
1680, by Angelica, the notable wife ov Rhehoboam Beecher,
then residing in the rural town ov Nu Guilford, State of Connekticut,
but since departed this life, aged 84 years, 3 months, 6
daze 5 hours, and 15 minnitts.</p>

<p>Peace tew her dust.</p>

<p>This pi, immejiately after its discovery bi Angelica, proceeded
into general use, and waz the boss pi, for over a hundred
years.</p>

<p>In the year 1833 it was totaly lorst.</p>

<p>This pi hain’t bin herd from since. Large rewards hav bin
offered for its recovery by the Govenor ov Connekticut, but
it haz undoubtedly fled forever.</p>

<p>“<i>Rum and Tansy.</i>”—Good old Nu England rum with
tanzy bruized in it, waz known to our ancients, and drank by
the deacons and the elders ov our churches, a century ago.</p>

<p>It iz now one ov the lost arts.</p>

<p>A haff a pint ov this glorious old mixtur upon gitting out
ov bed in the morning, then a haff a pint jist before sitting
down tew breakfast, then thru the day, at stated intervals, a
haff a pint ov it, and sum more ov it just before retiring at
nite, iz wat enabled our fourfathers tew shake oph the yoke
ov grate brittain, and gave the Amerikan eagle the majestik
tred and thundering big bak bone, which he used tew hav.
But, alass! oh, alass! we once had spirits ov just men made
perfek, but we hav now, (o alass!) spirits ov the dam.</p>

<p>One half-pint ov the present prevailing rum would ruin a

<div class="asterisks">
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
</div>

<p>“<i>Arly to bed, and arly to rize.</i>”</p>

<p>When our ancestors landed on Plimoth Rok out ov the Mayflower,
and stood in front ov the grate lanskape spred out
before them, reaching from the boisterious Atlantik to the
buzzum ov the plaintive Pacifick, they brought with them,
among other tools, the art ov gitting up in the morning and
going tew bed at nite in decent seazon.</p>

<p>This art they was az familiar to them, az codfish for brekfast.</p>

<p>They knu it bi heart.</p>

<p>It waz the eleventh command in their katekism.</p>

<p>They taut it tew their children, their yung men and maidens,
and if a yung one waz enny ways slow about larning it
he waz invited out to the korn-krib, and thare the art waz
explained tew him, so that he got hold ov the idee for ever
and amen.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that this art iz now lost, or missing.</p>

<p>What a loss waz here, my countrymen!</p>

<p>I pauze for a reply.</p>

<p>Not a word do I hear.</p>

<p>Silence iz its epitaph.</p>

<p>Perhaps some profane and unthinking cuss will exklaim—“<i>Let
her rip!</i>”</p>

<p>Arly tew bed and arly tew rize, is either a thing of the past
or a thing that ain’t cum—it certainly don’t exist in theze
parts now.</p>

<p>It haz not only gone itself, but it haz took oph a whole lot
ov good things with it.</p>

<p>This art will positively never be diskovered agin; it waz
the child ov innocense and vigor, and this breed ov children
are like the babes in the wood, and deserted bi their unkle.</p>

<p>“<i>Honesty.</i>”—Honesty iz one ov the arts and sciences.</p>

<p>Learned men will tell you that the abuv assershun iz one
<span id="pg_89" class="page_anchor">89 </span>
ov Josh Billings infernal lies, and yer hav a perfekt rite tew
believe them, but i don’t.</p>

<p>Honesty iz jist az much an art az politeness iz, and never
waz born with a man enny more than the capacity to spell
the word Nebuddkenozzer right the first time waz.</p>

<p>It took me seven years to master this word, and i and Noer
Webster both disagree about the right way now.</p>

<p>Sum men are natrally more addikted tew honesty than
others, jist az sum hav a better ear for musik, and larn how
tew hoist and lower the 8 notes, more completely than the
next man.</p>

<p>Honesty iz one ov the lost or mislaid arts—thare may be
excepshuns tew this rule, but the learned men all agree that
“excepshuns prove the rule.”</p>

<p>The only doubts i hav about this matter iz tew lokate the
time very cluss, when honesty waz fust lost.</p>

<p>When Adam in the garden of Eden waz asked, “<i>Whare
art thou Adam</i>” and afterwards explained hiz abscence by
saying, “<i>I, waz afraid</i>” iz az far back az I hav bin able tew
trace the fust indikashuns ov weakness in this grand and nobel
art.</p>

<p>I shouldn’t be suprized if this art never waz fully recovered
again during mi day.</p>

<p>I aint so anxious about it on mi own ackount, for i kan
manage tew worry along sumhow without it, but what iz a
going tew bekum ov the grate mass ov suffering humanity?</p>

<p>This iz a question that racks mi simpathetick buzzum!</p>

<h2 id="sec-36">HINTS TO COMIK LEKTURERS.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">C</span>omic</span> lekturing iz an unkommon pesky thing to do.</p>

<span id="pg_90" class="page_anchor">90 </span>

<p>When it iz did jist enuff, it iz a terifick success, but when
it iz overdid, it iz like a burnt slapjax, very impertinent.</p>

<p>Thare aint but phew good judges ov humor, and they all
differ about it.</p>

<p>If a lekturer trys tew be phunny, he iz like a hoss trying
to trot backwards, pretty apt tew trod on himself.</p>

<p class="caption">COMIK LEKTURE.</p>
</div>

<p>Humor must fall out ov a mans mouth, like musik out ov
a bobalink, or like a
yung bird out ov its
nest, when it iz feathered
enuff to fly.</p>

<p>Whenever a man
haz made up hiz mind
that he iz a wit, then
he iz mistaken without
remedy, but whenever
the publick haz
made up their mind
that he haz got the
disease, then he haz
got it sure.</p>

<p>Individuals never
git this thing right,
the publik never git
it wrong.</p>

<p>The publik never
cheat themselfs, nor other folks, when they weigh out glory.</p>

<p>Thare iz jist 16 ounces in a pound ov glory, and no more,
that is, by the publiks steelyards.</p>

<p>Humor iz wit with a roosters tail feathers stuck in its cap,
and wit iz wisdom in tight harness.</p>

<p>No man kan be a helthy phool unless he haz nussed at the
brest ov wisdom.</p>

<p>Thoze who fail in the comik bizzness are them who hav
bin put out to nuss, or bin fetched up on a bottle.</p>

<p>If a man iz a genuine humorist, he iz superior tew the bulk
ov hiz aujience, and will often times hav tew take hiz pay for
hiz services in thinking so.</p>

<span id="pg_91" class="page_anchor">91 </span>

<p>Altho fun iz designed for the millyun, and ethiks for the
few, it iz az true az molasses, that most all aujiences hav their
bell wethers, people who show the others the crack whare the
joke cums laffing in.</p>

<p>I hav known popular aujences deprived ov all plezzure during
the recital ov a comik lektur, just bekauze the right man,
or the right woman, want thare tew point out the mellow
places.</p>

<p>The man who iz anxious tew git before an aujience, with
what he calls a comik lektur, ought tew be put immediately
in the stocks, so that he kant do it, for he iz a dangerous person
tew git loose, and will do sum damage.</p>

<p>It iz a very pleazant bizzness tew make people laff, but
thare iz mutch odds whether they laff <i>at you</i>, or laff at <i>what
yu say</i>.</p>

<p>When a man laffs at <i>yu</i>, he duz it because it makes him feel
superior to you, but when yu pleaze him with what yu have
uttered, he admits that yu are superior tew him.</p>

<p>The only reazon whi a monkey alwus kreates a sensashun
whareever he goes, is simply bekauze—he is a monkey.</p>

<p>Everyboddy feels az tho they had a right tew criticize a
comik lectur, and most ov them do it jist az a mule criticizes
things, by shutting up both eyes and letting drive with hiz
two behind leggs.</p>

<p>Humor haz but phew rules tew be judged by, and they are so
delikate that none but the most delikate kan define them.</p>

<p>It is dredful arbitrary tew ask a man tew laff who don’t feel
the itch ov it.</p>

<p>One ov the meanest things in the comik lektring employment
that a man haz to do, iz tew try and make that large
class ov hiz aujience laff whom the Lord never intended should
laff.</p>

<p>Thare iz sum who laff az eazy and az natral az the birds do,
but most ov mankind laff like a hand organ—if yu expect tew
git a lively tune out ov it yu hav got tew grind for it.</p>

<p>In delivering a comik lektur it iz a good general rule to stop
sudden, sometime before yu git through. This enables the
<span id="pg_92" class="page_anchor">92 </span>
aujience, if they hav had enuff, tew be satisfied with what they
hav had, and if they want enny more, it enables them to hanker
for it.</p>

<p>I know it iz dredful tuff, when a man iz on one end ov a
stick ov molasses kandy, tew quit till he gits clean through;
but he musn’t forgit that hiz aujience may not be so sweet on
molassiss kandy az he iz.</p>

<p>I hav got a very lonesum opinyun ov the comik lektring
bizziness, and if I waz well shut ov it, and knu how tew git
an honest living at ennything else, (except opening clams, and
keeping a districkt skool,) i would quit tommorrow, and either
trade oph mi liktur for a grindstone, or sell it to the proprietors
ov sum insane hospital, to quiet their pashunts with.</p>

<p>I dont urge ennyboddy tew cultivate the comik lektring,
but if they feel phull ov something, they kan’t tell what,
that bites, and makes them feel ridikilous, so that they kan’t
even saw wood without laffing tew themselfs all the time, i
suppose they hav got the fun ailment in their bones, and had
better let it leak out in the shape ov a lektur.</p>

<p>But i advise all such persons to pitty themselfs, and when
they lay a warm joke, not tew akt az a hen doth when she haz
uttered an egg, but look sorry, and let sum one else do the
cackling.</p>

<p>If i had a boy who showed enny strong marks ov being a
comik critter, if i couldn’t get it out ov him enny other way,
i would jine him to the Shakers, and make him weed onions
for three years, just for fun.</p>

<p>Fits are the moral tumblings ov man’s natur, the bak summersets
ov hiz disposishun, the flying trapez ov the kritter
himself.</p>

<p>Fits prompt him tew klimb a greast pole, tew fite a wind
mill at short range, to go too near a mule’s heels, and to
make a kussid phool ov himself generally.</p>

<p>Fits taketh a man bi the end ov hiz noze, and leadeth him
into bak lots.</p>

<p>Fits hav no conshience, and no judgment.</p>

<p>Fits jerk a man from the path ov duty, they knok him
krazy at noontime, they seize him at twilite, and twist him
arly in the morning.</p>

<p>Sum men, and sum wimmen, are good only in fits, and bad
only in fits, when they haint got a fit they are unfit for

<p>Yes, i think so.</p>

<p>Fuss iz haff-sister to Hurry, and neither ov them kant do
enny thing without gitting in their own way and stepping on
themselfs.</p>

<p>Thare iz more fuss in this world than thare iz hurry, and
thare iz a thousand times more ov either ov them than thare

<p>Fuss works hard all day, and don’t do enny thing, goes to

<p>A fellow iz a hybrid; he hain’t got enny more karakter
than a drizzly day haz, he iz every boddy’s cuzzin, and hangs
around like a lost dog.</p>

<p>He iz often clever, and that iz jist what ruins him. A

<h2 id="sec-38">THE NU FOUNDLAND AND THE TARRIER.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">D</span>ogs</span> are one ov the luxurys ov civilizashun.</p>

<p>In uncivilized life they perhaps are more one ov the
necessitys, az they quite often are cooked, and eaten whole.</p>

<p>Among the civilized, if they ever do git onto a bill ov fare,
(ov which i have mi own private doubts,) they are more artisktly
handled, and enter into hash, or sassage, not az the
leading artikle, but more tew kreate a good average.</p>

<p>But i am not now disposed to treat ov dogs az vittles, but
as the companyun ov man, hiz pet, and hiz partner.</p>

<p>The Nu foundland dog iz a natiff ov the place whare the
nobel kodfish iz kaught.</p>

<p>He dont liv in the water, like the kodfish, but unlike the
kodfish, livs on the land.</p>

<p>Hiz principal amuzement iz saving life, and i am told that
thare iz hardly a man, or a woman, in all Nu foundland, but
what haz had their lives saved several times by these wonderful
dogs.</p>

<p>They are taken from Nu foundland to various parts ov the
world, and are kept for the purpose ov dragging the drowning
from a watery grave.</p>

<p>Yu will find them in mountaneous countrys, whare thare
aint enny water, but little brooks. Here they dont hav mutch
to do, in their line ov bizzness, and git verry fatt.</p>

<p>But i am told, that even here, they dont forget their natur,
and kan often be seen looking down into the wells, after
drowning men.</p>

<span id="pg_98" class="page_anchor">98 </span>

<p>This shows the grate power ov instinkt, and the force ov
bizzness habits, alwus looking for a job.</p>

<p>I never hav had mi life saved by one ov theze nobel kritters,
but am reddy tew hav it done, at enny time, at the usual
rates.</p>

<p>Life iz sweet, and it iz cheaper tew hav it saved by a dog
than by a doktor.</p>

<p>But these dogs are all hydropaths, and thare iz sum pholks
so kussid sentimental that they had rather die than be doktered
bi ennything else than an old skool allopath.</p>

</div>

<p>I am just phool enuff, if I waz in the pond, just at the pint
ov deth on ackount ov too mutch water, and thare waz a Nufoundland
dog standing on the shore out ov a job, I should let
him handle the case,
rather than send four
miles for a regular
dokter.</p>

<p>I may be all wrong
in this, but if the dog
hauled me out all
right, I should hav
time tew repent ov
mi blunder, and next
time send for a physician
with a diploma.</p>

<p>It iz never too late
tew repent ov a blunder,
not if you hav
got plenty ov time
on hand that you
don’t kno what to
do with.</p>

<p>I never hav owned
a Nufoundland dog, but just az soon as i git able tew board
one, without skrimping mi family, i mean to buy one, or borro
one, just for hiz board.</p>

<p>I don’t know ov ennything more magnificent than tew hav
<span id="pg_99" class="page_anchor">99 </span>
a grate illustrious Nufoundland dog tew follow yu in a
mountaneous country.</p>

<p>I liv at Pordunk (the home ov the Billings family) and
Pordunk iz not a wet place.</p>

<p>Thare iz sum good wells thare, and two grocerys, but the
water priviliges at Pordunk are used only az a beverage.</p>

<p>Thare iz only one Nufoundland dog now at Pordunk, and i
think the town would support two.</p>

<p>I don’t suppose i should hav work enuff tew keep one ov
theze nobel animals bizzy hauling drowning men out ov wells,
but in the spring ov the year, after the gardens waz made, i
could lend him out tew the nabors tew run in the gardens.</p>

<p>I don’t kno ov enny thing better tew keep the angleworms,
and early lettiss, and beets out ov a garden than a full-grown
Nufoundland pup.</p>

<p>It iz nothing but phun tew giv them a kalf-skin boot, and
turn them out into a nu-made garden, and see them kick up
their heels, stir up the garden, and jerk the boot.</p>

<p>I am almoste krazy tew hav a Nufoundland dog.</p>

<h3 id="sec-38-1">THE RAT TARRIER.</h3>

<p>Theze dear little pets ov the dog perswashun are natiffs ov
the ile ov Grate Brittain.</p>

<p>They are born there with grate precision and purity ov karakter,
hav a pedigree az klean az the queen’s, and as free from
spots az a nu tin dipper.</p>

<p>A rat tarrier who could ketch 97 rats a day, with a rust on
his pedigree, ain’t worth only haff az mutch in market az one
with a pure set ov ansestors, who couldn’t ketch only 43 rats.</p>

<p>It iz hard work for a kussed phool tew see this, but it takes
edukashun tew see theze things.</p>

<p>A man without edukashun kan stand out doors in a klear
night and count the moon, and he won’t see enny thing but
a grate chunk ov light sumthing bigger than a kartwheel.</p>

<p>But you let an edukated man stan out there by his side, and
he kan see turnpikes, and toll gates, and torch-lite proceshuns,
<span id="pg_100" class="page_anchor">100 </span>
and wimmin’s rites convenshuns, and municipal rings, and
koporashun thieving in it.</p>

<p>Edukashun iz bully.</p>

<p>The rat tarrier iz not so mutch dog, az a personal matter, az
the Nufoundland iz, but he haz more grit to the square inch.</p>

<p>Just so the hornet haz got more sting tew them than a
shanghi pullet haz, and an angleworm haz more grit in them
than an hanakonda haz. Natur bosses these jobs, and natur
never underlets a kontract. There is one thing I alwus did
like natur for, she don’t take the trouble tew explain. She don’t
object tew persons asking questions, and guessing at things,
but if enny boddy asks her whi a frog kan jump further at
one highst than a tud kan, she tells the phellow (if she tells
him ennything) never tew bet on the tud, unless he wants tew
looze his munny.</p>

<p>I never hav had the happiness yet to own a rat tarrier even,
in fakt i hav allus been poor, and haven’t been beforehanded
enuff yet tew own a dog.</p>

<p>I mean sum time tew hav a rat tarrier, and then I suppoze,
to enjoy myself, I shall have tew git sum rats. This iz the
way with all the luxurys ov life, one luxury makes another
one necessary. Thar iz one thing certain, if i ever do own a
Nufoundland, or rat tarrier, they hav got tew be thorobred.
I must kno all ov their relashuns, inkluding their mother-in-law,
and if thare iz a blot on thur reputashun, as big as a fli
spek, the dog wont sute me.</p>

<p>I must hav the pedigree all rite, if the dog aint wuth a kuss.</p>

<h2 id="sec-39">THE MONKEY.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> monkey iz a human being, a little undersised, kivvered
with hair, hitched to a tail, and filled with the devil.</p>

<p>Naturalists will tell you, if you ask them, that i am mistaken,
that i mean well enuff, and don’t mean tew deceive ennybody,
but the monkey iz not a human being, he iz simply a
<span id="pg_101" class="page_anchor">101 </span>
pun on humanity, a kind of malishus joke ov Jupiter’s, a libel,
with a long tail tew it, a misterious mixtur ov ludikrous mischief,
and stale humor, a kind of pacing hobbyhoss, or connekting
gang-plank, between man in his dignity and the beast
in his darkness.</p>

<p>I hav a hi opinyun ov the naturalist, and all kinds ov the
dictionary fraternity, and touch mi hat tew them, when we
meet, and i respect them for what they know, but don’t worship
them for what they don’t know, as the heathens do, their
wodden gods.</p>

<p>I don’t kare what the philosophers say they kan prove in
this matter, i tell you confidenshally, mi christian friend, that
you and the monkey, are relashuns.</p>

<p>I don’t pretend tew say that you are brothers and sisters,
but i do pretend tew state, that monkeys, or enny other kind
ov critters, who exercise reason, even if the light ov it, is dim
az a number six dip candle, in the rays ov the noon day sun,
are our relashuns, for a certain amount.</p>

<p>The only fence between the animal and brute folks, iz
instinkt and reason, and if the natralist kant prove that the
monkey don’t show a single glimmering ov reason, i say he
must step oph from the monkey’s tail, and let him eat at the
fust table.</p>

<p>The monkey iz imitative tew the highest degree, and imitashun
iz a direkt transgreshun ov the law ov instinkt, and iz
fallow ground within the domain of reazon.</p>

<p>Instinkt don’t step one single step aside, tew smell ov a
flower or pull a cat’s tail.</p>

<p>But argument ain’t mi fighting weight, i git along the best
by asserting things az they strike me, and i say upwards ov
four thousand things every year, that i kant prove, enny more
than i kan prove what melody iz.</p>

<p>The naturalist may hav their own way, but they kant hav
mine, what little i know about things haz bin whispered tew
me by the spirits, or some other romping critters, and is az
distinkt and butiful, sumtimes to me, as a dream on an empty
stummuk; it may be all wrong but it never iz viscious, and
thus i konklude it iz edukashun.</p>

<span id="pg_102" class="page_anchor">102 </span>

<p>Now i don’t advise ennybody else tew depend for their
learning upon sich prekarious school masters, the best way iz
tew follow the ruts, it will take you to town just az it did yure
daddy.</p>

<p>The route that i travel iz cirkuitus and blind sometimes, it
haz now and then a vista, or a landscape in it, that iz worth,
tew me, more than a farm ov tillable land, but you kant raize
good white beans on a landskape.</p>

<p>Whenever i drop mi subject, and begin tew strut in the
subburbs ov sentimentility and proverbial pomposity, i alwus
think ov a gobble turkey, in a barn-yard, on dress parade,
and that is jist what i am thinking ov now, and therefore i
will dismount from the turkey, and git aboard the monkey,
(the monkey az he am) once more.</p>

<p>Pure deviltry iz the monkeys right bower; he iz only valuable,
(az personal property) tew look at, and wonder what
he iz a going tew do next.</p>

<p>He iz a jack at all trades, put him in a barber shop, he will
lather, and try tew shave himself, and color his mustash, put
him in a dri good store, and he will handle more goods, than
the best retail clerk in A. T. Stewart’s employ.</p>

<p>The monkey haz not got a logikal head, it iz tew mutch
like a pin hed, all in a heap to onst, but hiz face is a concentrated
dew drop of malishus mischief.</p>

<p>He resembles the rat tarrier in countenance, and skratches
hiz hed, az natral az a distrikt skool boy, and undoubtedly for
the same reason.</p>

<p>Monkeys never grow enny older in expreshun, a yung monkey
looks just like his grandpapa, melted up and born again.</p>

<p>They are sometimes kept as pets, but i should rather watch
two adopted orphan boys, fresh from the Home of the Friendless,
than two monkeys.</p>

<p>They will eat everything that a man will, except bolony
sarsage, here they show more instinkt, than reason.</p>

<p>But after all, tho the monkey shows evident sighns ov reazon,
they are, az a means ov praktikal grace, the most useless
kritters i hav ever pondered over and skratched mi head about.</p>

<span id="pg_103" class="page_anchor">103 </span>

<p>They won’t work, and they won’t play, unless they kan
raize sum devil, they are too mutch like a human being in
looks, and actions to kill off, it is impossible tew gaze at one
and git mad at him, and it iz impossible tew laff at their smirking
santanity, without getting mad at yureself.</p>

<p>If enny boddy should make me a present ov a monkey, i
don’t know now, whether i should konsider it intended for
malice, or a joke, but i do know, that i should send him back
bi the same person that fetched him, tew the donor, marked
in loud italicks—<i>C. O. D.</i></p>

<p>In conklusion; thare iz only one thing that i have a grate
supply ov doubt about, in reference tew the monkey, and that
iz his moral stamina, while in the garden ov Eden, with the
rest ov the critters, previous tew the time that Adam fell;—was
he strickly on the square, or was he just az full ov the
devil az he is now?</p>

<p>An answer tew the above konumdrum iz earnestly solicited.</p>

<h2 id="sec-40">THE PISSMIRE.</h2>

<p>They are like sum men, alwus very bizzy about sumthing,
but what it iz, the Lord only knows.</p>

<p>I never see a pissmire yet that wasn’t on the travel, but i
hav watched them all day long, and never see them git tew the
place they started for.</p>

<p>Just before a hard shower they are in the biggest hurry,
they seem tew postpone every thing for that ockashun.</p>

<p>Thar iz a grate difference between hurry and dispatch, but
pissmires dont seem to understand the difference.</p>

<p>If pissmires would go slower I should like them better, for
i dont know ov ennything more <ins title="Note: “unpleasaut” in the original" id="cg_38">unpleasant</ins> to view, than an

<p>A pissmire iz like a boys wind mill, on the gable end ov a

<h2 id="sec-41">THE POLE KAT.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">M</span>y</span> friend, did yu ever examin the fragrant pole kat clussly?
I guess not, they are a kritter who won’t bear examining
with a microskope.</p>

<p>They are butiful beings, but oh! how deceptive.</p>

<p>Their habits are phew, but unique.</p>

<p>They bild their houses out ov earth and the houses hav but
one door tew them, and that iz a front door.</p>

<p>When they enter their houses they don’t shut the door after
them.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill-15">
<a href="images/ill-16.jpg"><img src="images/ill-16_min.jpg" alt="THE POLE-CAT"></a>
</div>

<p>They are called pole kats bekause it iz not convenient tew
kill them with a klub,
but with a pole, and
the longer the pole
the more convenient.</p>

<p>Writers on natural
history, dissagree
about the right length
ov the pole tew be
used, but i would suggest,
that the pole be
about 365 feet, espeshily
if the wind iz in
favor ov the pole kat.</p>

<p>When a pole kat
iz suddenly walloped
with a long pole, the
fust thing he, she, or
it duz, iz tew embalm
the air, for menny
miles in diameter, with an akrlmonious olifaktory refreshment,
which permeates the ethereal fluid, with an entirely original
smell.</p>

<span id="pg_105" class="page_anchor">105 </span>

<p>This smell iz less popular, in the fashionable world, than
lubins extrakt, but the day may cum when it will be bottled
up like musk, and sold for 87 1-2 cents per bottle; bottles
small at that.</p>

<p>A pole kat will remove the filling from a hens egg, without
braking a hole in the shell, bigger than a marrow fat pea.</p>

<p>How this iz did historians hav left us to doubt.</p>

<p>This iz vulgarily called “surking eggs.”</p>

<p>This iz an accomplishment known amung humans, which it
iz sed, they hav learnt from the pole kats.</p>

<p>Pole kats also deal in chickens, yung turkeys, and yung
goslins.</p>

<p>They won’t tutch an old goose, they are sound on that
question.</p>

<p>Man iz the only phellow who will attempt tew bight into an
old goose, and his teeth fly oph a grate menny times before he
loosens enny ov the meat.</p>

<p>A pole kat travels under an alias, which is called <i>skunk</i>.
Thare iz a grate menny <i>aliases</i> that thare iz no accounting for,
and this iz one ov them.</p>

<p>I hav kaught skunks in a trap. They are eazier tew git into
a trap than tew git out ov it.</p>

<p>In taking them out ov a trap grate judgment must be had
not tew shake them up; the more yu shake them up the more
ambrosial they am.</p>

<p>One pole kat in a township is enuff, espeshily if the wind
changes once in a while.</p>

<p>A pole kat skin iz wuth 2 dollars, in market, after it iz
skinned, but it iz wuth 3 dollars and fifty cents tew skin
him.</p>

<p>This iz one way tew make 12 shillings in a wet day.</p>

<h2 id="sec-42">THE WEAZEL.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> weazel haz an eye like a hawk, and a tooth like a pickerel.</p>

<p>They kan see on all three sides of a right angle tri angle
board fence, at once, and kan bite thru a side ov sole leather.</p>

<span id="pg_106" class="page_anchor">106 </span>

<p>They alwus sleep with one eye open, and the other on the
wink, and are quicker than spirits ov turpentine, and a lighted
match.</p>

<p>It iz no disgrace for a streak ov litening tew strike at a weazel
and miss him.</p>

<p>If I owned a weazel, litening mite strike at him all day for
50 cents a clap.</p>

<p>I hav tried tew kill them in a stun wall with a rifle, but
they would dodge the ball, when it got within six inches ov
them, and stick their heads out ov another krack, three feet
further oph.</p>

<p>They are the hardest kritter amung the small game tew
ketch or tew kill, yu kant coax one into a trap, and keep him
thare, enny more than yu could ketch a ray of light, with a
knot hole.</p>

<p>Weazles are skarse, but the supply alwus equals the demand,
they aint useful only for one thing, and that iz, too kill
chickens.</p>

<p>They will kill 14 chickens in one night, and take off the
blood with them, leaving the corpse behind.</p>

<p>I hunted 3 weeks for a weazle once (it iz now six years ago),
and knu just whare he waz all the the time, and hain’t got
him yet.</p>

<p>I offered 10 dollars reward for him, and hold the stakes
yet.</p>

<p>Every boy in that naborhood waz after that weazle nite
and day, and I had tew withdraw the reward to keep from
breaking up the distrikt skool.</p>

<p>The skoolmaster threatened tew su me if i didn’t, and i did
it, for i hate a law suit rather wuss than i do a weazle.</p>

<p>A weazle’s skin, wore on the neck, it iz sed, will kure the
quinsy sore thrut, but the phellow who sed this had a sure
thing; he knu nobody could ketch the weazle.</p>

<p>I waz told, when i waz a boy, by a cunning cuss, that the
way tew ketch a crow waz tew put sum salt on hiz tail. I
prakticed all one summer on this, but never got sum crow.</p>

<p>I hav did things az foolish az this since i hav quit being a
boy, but prefer tew keep mum what they are.</p>

<span id="pg_107" class="page_anchor">107 </span>

<p>Weazles hav got no wisdum, but hav got what iz sumtimes
mistaken for it, they hav got cunning.</p>

<p>Cunning stands in the same relashun tew wisdum that a tadpole
duz tew a frog, he may git tew be a frog if he keeps on
growing, but he aint one now.</p>

<p>Wisdum knows how tew jump, but about the best thing
that cunning can do iz tew wiggle.</p>

<p>I hav saw cunning men who thought they waz wize, but i
never saw a wise man who thought he waz cunning.</p>

yu must manure yure sile. There aint nothing on arth more
miserable tew ponder over and weep about than a half starved

handy tew hoe, for they plant and harvest themselfs. They

<p>It iz sed by the naturalists that angle worm ile, rubbed on
the rear ov the neck, will kure a man ov the lies. I don’t
beleave this, unless it kills the man. Death iz the only reliable
heal for lieing that has bin diskovered yet.</p>

<p>When lieing gits into a man’s blood, the only way tew git

take oph, az enny boddy knows, who haz straddled a saw log
and fished for daice all day long Sunday in a mill pond.</p>

<p>Old fishermen alwus carry their worms in their mouth.</p>

<p>Angle worms liv in a round hole, which they fit like a gimlet,
<span id="pg_108" class="page_anchor">108 </span>
and are diffrent from aul other creeps that I kno ov, for
they alwus back into their holes.</p>

<p>Here the natral angle worm ends.</p>

<h2 id="sec-44">THE MOUSE.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">E</span>ver</span> since natur waz diskovered, mice hav had a hole tew
till.</p>

<p>Paradise, az good a job az it waz, would not hav bin thoroughly
fitted up without a mouse tew dart akross the bowers
like a shaddo, and Eve would never have knu how tew skream
pretty without one ov these little teachers.</p>

<p>Adam would never hav bin fit tew kontend with the job ov
gitting a living outside the garden if he hadn’t trapped suckcessfully
for a mouse.</p>

<p>Ketching a mouse iz the fust cunning thing that every
man duz.</p>

<p>Mice are the epitome of shrewdness; their faces beam with
sharp praktiss; their little noses smell ov cunning, and their
little black-beaded eyes titter with pettit larceny.</p>

<p>They are az cheerful az the criket on the harth. <ins title="Note: “i” in the original" id="cg_39">I</ins> should be
afrade tew buy a house that hadn’t a mouse-hole in it.</p>

<p>I like tew see them shoot out ov their hole in the korner,
like a wad out ov a pop-gun, and stream akross the nursery,
and to hear one nibble in the wainscot, in the midst ov the
night, takes the death out ov silence.</p>

<p>Mice alwus move into a new house fust, and are there reddy
tew receive and welkum the rest ov the family.</p>

<p>They are more ornamental than useful, ackording to the best
informashun we hav az yet; but this iz the case with most
things.</p>

<p>Mice cum into this world tew seek their fortune, four at a
time, and lay in their little kradles ov cotton or wool, like bits
ov rare-dun meat, for a month, with not a rag on them.</p>

<span id="pg_109" class="page_anchor">109 </span>

<p>When they dine, they do it jist az a family ov yung piggs
duz: each one at their own particular spot at the table, and it
is seldum that yu see better-behaved boarders, or them that
understand their bizzness more thoroughly.</p>

<p>I hav seen them at their meals, and i will take mi oath that
everything iz orderly, and az strikly on the square, as a checker-board.</p>

<p>When mice hav reached their manhood, their tales are just
the same length az their boddys. This would seem at fust
sight tew be a grate waste ov tail.</p>

<p>The philosophik mind, ever at work, applying means tew
ends, might be a bigg phool enuff tew want to know whi a bob-tailed
mouse wouldn’t be a better finished job; but philosophy
haz no bizzness tew alter things to suit the market. It must
take mouse-tails just az they cum, and either glorify them, or
shut up.</p>

<p>If there want ennybody in the natral philosophy trade, i hav
thought it would be jist as well for natur bekause a man, if he
kant orthodox a reason for the entire length ov a mouse’s tale
iz often willing tew tell hiz nabors that the whole critter iz a
failure.</p>

<p>Sutch iz man; but a mouse iz a mouse.</p>

<p>The mouse kan live ennywhare tew advantage, except in a
church. They phatt very slow in a church. This goes tew
show that they kant live on religion enny more than a minister
kan. Religion iz excellent for digestion.</p>

<p>Thare aint a more prolifick thing on earth (prolifick ov fun i
mean now) than a mouse in a distrikt school-house. They are
better than a fire-cracker tew stir up a school-marm with, and
are just the things tew throw spellin books at when they are on
the run.</p>

<p>One mouse will edukate a parcell ov yung ones more in ten
minnitts during school time than you can substrakt out ov
their heds in three days with Daballs arithmetik.</p>

<p>Now thare iz many folks who kant see enny thing to write
about in a mouse; but mice are full ov informashun. The only
way that edukashun was fust discovered waz bi going tew
<span id="pg_110" class="page_anchor">110 </span>
school to natur. Books, if they are sound on the goose, are
only natur in tipe.</p>

<p>A grate many kontend that a mouse iz a useless kritter; but
kan they prove it?</p>

<p>I am willing to give an opinyun that too menny mice might
not pay; but this applies to musketoze, elephants, and side-wheel
steambotes.</p>

<p>A mouse’s tale iz az unhairy az a shustring. This iz another
thing that bothers the philosophers, and i aint agoing to
explain it unless i am paid for it.</p>

<p>I hav alreddy explained a grate menny things in the nuzepapers
that i never got a cent for.</p>

<p>There aint nothing on earth that will fit a hole so snug az a
mouse will. Yu would think they waz made on purpose for it,
and they will fill it quicker, too, than ennything i ever saw.
If yu want to see a mouse enter hiz hole, yu mustn’t wink. If
do, yu will hav tew wait till next time.</p>

<p>I luv mice. They seem tew belong to us.</p>

<p>Rats i dont luv. They lack refinement.</p>

<h2 id="sec-45">THE YALLER DOG.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">D</span>ogs</span> hav infested this world just about az long az man
haz, and will hang around it, az long az thare is enny
grizzle left on a bone.</p>

<p>We hav no reliable ackount ov the fust dog, and probably
shant hav ov the final one.</p>

<p>If Adam kept a tarrier, or Eve a poodle, the laps of ages hav
washed away the fakt.</p>

<p>If Noah had a pair ov each breed ov dogs, on board ov hiz
vessell, and only one pair ov fleas, he waz well ont for dogs,
and poor ont for fleas. But history iz numb on this subjekt.</p>

<p>Esaw waz a mity hunter, but whether he kept a houn, or
followed the cent himself, iz az ded, and departed to us, az the
chirp ov the fust reliable cricket.</p>

<span id="pg_111" class="page_anchor">111 </span>

<p>We read that Esaw sold out hiz birth rite for soup, and
menny wonder at hiz extravegance, but Esaw diskovered arly,
what menny a man haz diskovered since, that it iz hard work
tew live on a pedigree.</p>

<p>If i waz starving, I wouldn’t hesitate tew swap oph all the
pedigree I had, and all mi relashuns had, for a quart of pottage,
and throw two grate grandfathers into the bargain.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill-16">
<a href="images/ill-17.jpg"><img src="images/ill-17_min.jpg" alt=""></a>
</div>

<p>But I don’t intend
this essa for
dogs in the lump,
but for the individual
yellar dog himself.</p>

<p>The yellar dog
haz no pedigree,
the blood in hiz
veins iz az krude
az petroleum, when
it fust cums pumping
out ov the
earth, bitter, thick,
and fiery.</p>

<p>He iz long, and
lazily put together,
hiz ears flop when
he shacks along the dusty thoroughfare, and hiz tail iz a burden.</p>

<p>Thare iz no animashun in a yeller dog’s tail, it iz useless,
the flies aint even afraid ov it, it iz wus than a 10 per cent
mortgage tew the rest ov hiz boddy.</p>

<p>Whi the Yeller dog aint born diskounted, iz a mistery tew
me, but when i ask miself, “Whare would yu hitch the tin
pan to,” then at once the folly ov a bob tailed yeller dog,
flashes on mi mind.</p>

<p>Ever since this kontinent waz found bi Christopher Columbus,
in 1492, and for what i kno, much time previous tew that,
<span id="pg_112" class="page_anchor">112 </span>
the Yeller dog haz been a vagrant, travelling bi moon lite,
and hungry bi natur.</p>

<p>Whare he cums from noboddy seems to know, and if yu
speak a kind word tew him, he thinks it a kite in disguise,
and straddling hiz tail, with both hind legs, he goes suspicious,
and sideways, on his lonesum jurney.</p>

<p>Mankind hav made him a vagabond, and life to him iz made
up ov starvashun, and brickbats.</p>

<p>If he cums out ov hiz lurking place in the hot ov august,
he iz a “<i>mad dog</i>,” and the common council at once assemble,
the riot act iz read, 50 dollars reward iz offered, men cum panting
into town, crieing “<i>mad dog</i>,” their two horse waggon
waz bit that morning, bi a yaller dog, the fury rages, old guns
are kleaned up, the cannon iz run out on the village green,
dames talk to dames ov the awful event, men look sober and
defiant, boys pocket their marbles in the midst ov the game,
pigs run squealing tew their hovels, and the whole boddy
politik surges with horror.</p>

<p>The poor innocent whelp haz done hiz worst, and while a
whole village iz in the extacys ov hydrophobia he has passed
on, and may be seen, tugging away, in the subburbs, at the
shin bone ov a departed omnibus hoss.</p>

<p>The yeller dog haz but one friend among men, and that iz
the darkey.</p>

<p>A common misfortune links them together.</p>

<p>Why iz it, that the old negro, and hiz yeller dog, are vagabonds
on the face ov the earth?</p>

<p>Mans inhumanity iz wuss than the malice ov wild beasts.</p>

<p>A day ov reckoning will cum, a day ov judgment, and i
kant tell but what the yeller dog will be thare, a mute witness,
and then, and thare, will the grate problem be solved.</p>

<p>This wurld iz phull ov grate wrongs, and the next one will
az certainly be az phull ov grate retribushuns.</p>

<p>I kant endure the sight ov oppreshun, it disgraces mi manhood<ins title="Note: “.” in the original" id="cg_40">,</ins>
if i had money enuff i would like tew buy even all
the yeller dogs thare iz now on the buzzum ov the earth, and
make them respekted and happy.</p>

<span id="pg_113" class="page_anchor">113 </span>

<p>But i haint got the money, nor never shall hav, but az long
az i hav strength tew steer a gooze quill, and blood enuff in
mi heart for ink, i will bid mankind beware ov oppreshun, i
dont kare whether it is in hi places or low, the oppreshun ov
caste, the oppreshun ov wealth, or even the low, and degrading
oppreshun, ov a tin pale, in hot pursuit, ov the friendless,
yelping, yeller dog.</p>

<p>Yeller dogs will sumtime, and sumwhare, hav their day,
and when the huge piles ov brikbats, and mountains ov old
tin ware, cums into court, i want tew be thare, for i am anxious
tew know what the line ov defence will be.</p>

<h2 id="sec-46">ROOSTERS.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>hare</span> is not on the whole horizon or ov live natur a
more pleazing and strengthening studdy than the Rooster.
This remarkable package of feathers has bin for ages food for
philosophik, as well as the simple currious mind. They
belong tew the feathered sekt denominated poultry, and are
the husbands of menny wives. In Utah it is konsidered a
disgrace tew speak disrespekful of a rooster. Brigham
Young’s coat ov arms is a rooster, in full blast, crowing till
he is almost bent over double backwards.</p>

<p>The flesh ov the rooster is very similar tew the flesh ov the
hen; it is hard tew distinguish the diffrence espeshily in yure
soup. Roosters are the pugilists amung the domestik burds;
they wear the belt, and having no shoulder tew strike from,
they strike from the heel.</p>

<p>Roosters, according to profane history, if mi edukashun
remembers me right, were formerly a man, who come suddenly
upon one ov the heathen gods, at a time when he want
prepared tew see company, and waz, fur that offense, rebuilt
over into the fust rooster, and waz forever afterward destined to
crow, as a kind ov warning. This change from a man akounts
for their fighting abilities, and for their politeness tew the
<span id="pg_114" class="page_anchor">114 </span>
hens. Thare is nothing in a man that a woman admires
more than his reddyness and ability tew smash another fellow,
and it iz jiss so with a hen. When a rooster gits licked, the
hens all march oph with the other rooster, if he ain’t haff so
big or handsome.</p>

<p>It iz pluck that wins a hen or a woman.</p>

<p>Thare iz grate variety ov pedigree amung the rooster
race, but for stiddy bizzness give me the old fash dominique
rooster, short-legged, and when they walk, they alwus strut,
and their buzzums stick out, like an alderman’s abdominal
cupboard. This breed iz hawk-colored, and haz a crooked
tail on them, arched like a sickle, and az full ov feathers as a
new duster.</p>

<p>But when you come right down to grit, and throw all outside
influences overboard, thare aint nothing on earth, nor
under it, that kan out-style, out-step, out-brag, or out-pluck a
regular Bantam rooster.</p>

<p>They alwus put me in mind ov a small dandy, prakticing
before a looking-glass.</p>

<p>They don’t weigh more than 30 ounces, but they make az
mutch fuss az a ton, i have seen them trieing tew pik a quarrel
with a two hoss waggon, and don’t think they would hesitate
tew fight a meeting house, if it waz the least bit sassy
tew them.</p>

<p>It is more than fun tew hear one ov these little chevaliers
crow, it iz like a four-year old baby trieing tew sing a line
out ov the Star Spangled Banner.</p>

<p>The hen partner in this concern iz the most exquisit little
boquet ov neatness and feathers that the eye ever roosted on.
They are az prim az a premature yung lady. It is a luxury
to watch their daintyness, tew see them lay each feather with
their bills, in its place, and preside over themselfs with az
mutch delikasy and pride az a belle before her mirror.</p>

<p>But the consumation iz tew see the wife a mother, leading
out six little chicks a bugging; six little chicks no bigger than
bumbelbees.</p>

<p>It seems tew be necessary that there should be sumthing
<span id="pg_115" class="page_anchor">115 </span>
outrageous in evrything, tew show us whare propriety ends
and impropriety begins. This iz melancholly, the case in the
rooster affair, for we hav the shanghi rooster, the gratest outrage,
in mi opinyun, ever committed in the annals ov poultry.</p>

<p>Theze kritters are the camels amung fowls, they mope
around the barnyard, tipping over the hay racks and stepping
on the yung goslins, and evry now and then they crow confusion.</p>

<p>If enny body should giv me a shanghi rooster i should
halter him, and keep him in a box stall, and feed him on
cut feed, and if he would work kind in harness, all right, if
not, i would butcher him the fust wet day that cum, and salt
him down tew give tew the poor.</p>

<p>But thare ain’t noboddy a going tew giv me one ov this
breed, knot if i know it, i don’t think thare iz a man on earth
mean enuff to do it.</p>

<p>Roosters do but very little household work, they wont lay
enny eggs, nor try tew hatch enny, nor see tew the yung
ones; this satisfys me that thare is sum truth in the mythologikal
ackount ov the rooster’s fust origin.</p>

<p>Yu kant git a rooster to pay enny attenshun tew a yung
one, they spend their time in crowing, strutting, and occassionly
find a worm, which they make a remarkabell fuss over,
calling up their wifes from a distance, apparently tew treat
them, but just az the hens git thare, this elegant and elaborate
cuss bends over and gobbles up the morsel.</p>

<p><i>Just like a man, for all the world.</i></p>

<h2 id="sec-47">THE FOX.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">O</span>f</span> all the beasts who roam the hill tops, or clime the plains,
thare is none who makes so few blunders, and so many
good hits as the fox.</p>

<p>His shewdness iz more than a match for the lion’s strength,
his logick iz more than a match for the malice ov the wolf
<span id="pg_116" class="page_anchor">116 </span>
and hiz politeness and defference makes him the fop and gentleman
ov the forest.</p>

<p>The fox is a literary cuss; he haz been the hero ov history,
fable, and song, from the fust dawn ov oral or written knowledge.
He waz a genius long before ackedemick honors
flourished; he waz a poet, skoller and sage before the days ov
Homer and Herodotus, and now, in our times, he is the Ben
Butler ov diplomacy an the Brigham Young ov matrimony.</p>

<p>The fox is purely a game bird. It costs on an average fifty
dollars tew ketch him, and when he iz caught he aint worth
more than ten shillings. He follers no regular bizzness for
sustenance, but livs on the chances and on hiz wit.</p>

<p>He iz a fleshy-minded sinner, and hiz blandness iz too
mutch for the quaintness ov the goose, the melankolly reserve
ov the turkey, or the pompous rhetorick ov the rooster.
They all kneel tew the logick of hiz tounge, and find themselfs
at rest in his stummuk.</p>

<p>He luvs lam &amp; green peas, but will diskount the peas
rather than lose hiz dinner, and will go a mile and a half out
ov his way to be polite to a duck or a goslin.</p>

<p>But the most lively trait in the fox iz his cunning; he alwas
pettyfogs hiz own case, and wins a great deal oftener than he
loses.</p>

<p>Foxes are not like men, kritters ov habit; they never do a
thing twice with the same figures, and often alter their mind
before they do a thing once. This is the effect of too mutch
genius.</p>

<p>There iz this difference between genius and common sense
in a fox: Common sense iz governed bi circumstances, but
circumstances iz governed by genius.</p>

<p>The fox haz no moral honesty, but he haz got a grate supply
ov politikal honesty. If another fox in his parish wants
a phatt goose, he will work hard and get the goose for him,
and then clean the meat all oph from the outskirts ov the
goose for pettyfogging the case, and giv him the bones, and
tell hiz politikal friend, with a smile in the left corner of his
eye, that “everything is lovely and the goose hangs high.”</p>

<span id="pg_117" class="page_anchor">117 </span>

<div class="illustration" id="ill-17">
<a href="images/ill-18.jpg"><img src="images/ill-18_min.jpg" alt="RAFFLE THIS EVENING"></a>
<p class="caption">A SLY FOX—THE MORE YOU PUT DOWN THE
LESS YOU TAKE UP.</p>
</div>

<p>Foxes have learnt this piety from watching the men git
geese for each other, and if animals don’t want their piety
tew git sour, they must keep away from the men week days.
The fox is tew mutch ov a pollytician to invest his religion
in enny sich indigenous trash. He knows that sosiety haz
claims on him, and
are indebted tew him
for sum goose, and expekt
to be for several
more. This iz a nobel
trait in the fox, and
shows that he aint a
child ov ingratitude.</p>

<p>Foxes cum out ov the
ground, but whether
they are made out ov
dirt i kant sware with
much certainty. They
cum out ov the ground
through the instrumentality
ov a hole, but
whether the hole begins
at the surface and runs
into the mountain, or
whether it begins in the
mountain and runs tew the surface, don’t make a kussid bit
ov difference.</p>

<p>But philosophers hav argued about this hole bizzness for
years. Sum ov them say it runs in, and sum ov them be
darned if it duz; and right here we can see the amazing difference
between the logick ov the philosophers and the logick
ov the fox. While they stand fiteing at the mouth ov the
hole, the fox iz stealing their ducks and goslins.</p>

<p>Foxes are like cunning men—they hav but few brains, and
but a small place tew keep them in, but what few they hav
got are like angle worms in hot water—full ov anxiety and
mizery.</p>

<span id="pg_118" class="page_anchor">118 </span>

<p>Cunning is a branding iron; the letters on it are small, but
alwus red-hot, and they read thus—Look out for the fox.</p>

<p>Most all the animile kritters hav instinkt, which is wuth
more to them than reason would be, for instinkt don’t make
enny blunders.</p>

<p>If the animiles had reason, they would akt just as ridikilus
as we men folks do.</p>

<p>But a hen don’t seem tew hav even instinkt, and was made
expressly for a phool.</p>

<p>I hav seen a hen fly out ov a good warm shelter, on the
15th ov January, when the snow was 3 foot high, and lite on
the top ov a stun wall, and coolly set thare, and freeze tew
deth.</p>

<p>Noboddy but a darn phool would do this, unless it was tew
save a bet.</p>

<span id="pg_121" class="page_anchor">121 </span>

<p>I hav saw a human being do similar things, but they did it
tew win a bet.</p>

<p>To save a bet, is self-preservashun, and self-preservashun, is
the fust law ov natur, so sez Blakstone, and he is the best
judge ov law now living.</p>

<p>If i couldn’t be Josh Billings, i would like, next in suit
tew be Blakstone, and compoze sum law.</p>

<p>Thare iz one law i would compoze, which iz this, “no
yung snob shall walk on 5th avenew on the Sabbath day,
and twitch hiz hat oph more than two times, on each block,
to persons on the opposite side ov the street, whom he dont
kno, and who dont know him.<ins title="Note: absent in the original" id="cg_42">”</ins></p>

<p>I would hav this law compozed in brass, and send a coppy
ov it to all the bar tenders, and cigar shop clerks, in the city.</p>

<p>This would soon put a stop tew this kind ov snobosity.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding all this, a hen continues tew be a
darn phool.</p>

<p>I like all kinds ov phools, they cum nearer tew filling their
destiny than ennyboddy i kno ov.</p>

<p>They don’t never make enny blunders, but tend rite tew
bizzness.</p>

<p>The principal bizzness, ov an able boddyed hen, iz tew lay
eggs, and when she haz laid 36 ov them, then she iz ordained
tew set still on them, until they are born, this iz the way
yung hens fust see life.</p>

<p>The hen haz tew spred herself pretty well tew cover 36
eggs, but i hav seen her do it, and hatch out 36 yung hens.</p>

<p>When a hen fust walks out, with 36 yung hens supporting
her, the party looks like a swarm ov bumble bees.</p>

<p>Thare aint nothing phoolish in all this, but yu put 36 white
stuns, under this same hen, and she will set thare till she
hatches out the stones.</p>

<p>I hav seen them do this too—i dont wish tew say, that i
hav seen them <i>hatch out the stones</i>, but i hav seen them set
on the stones, untill i left that naberhood, which waz two
years ago, and i dont hesitate tew say, the hen iz still at
work, on that same job.</p>

<span id="pg_122" class="page_anchor">122 </span>

<p>Noboddy but a phool would stik tew bizzness az cluss az
this.</p>

<p>Hens are older than Methuseler, and gro older till they die.</p>

<p>Now I dont want it understood, that enny one hen ken,
kan commense life, with the usual kapital, and live 999 years.</p>

<p>This waz the exact age ov Methuseler, if I have been
informed correktly.</p>

<p>I simply want tew be understood, that hens (az a speciality)
laid, cackled, and sot a long time before Methuseler
did.</p>

<p>After reading this last statement over agin, i dont kno az i
make myself fluently understood yet.</p>

<p>I dont undertake tew say, that Mr. Methuseler, <i>cackled</i>,
and <i>sot</i>, what i want tew prove, iz the fakt, that hens were
here, and doing bizzness in their line, before Methuseler waz.</p>

<p>Now I hav got it.</p>

<p>Thare iz one thing about a hen that looks like wisdum,
they don’t cackle mutch untill after they have laid their egg.</p>

<p>Sum pholks are alwus a bragging, and a cackling, what they
are going tew do before-hand.</p>

<p>A hen will set on one egg just az honest az she will set on
36 eggs, but a hen with one chicken iz always a painful sight
tew me.</p>

<p>I never knu an only chicken do fust rate, the old hen spiles
them waiting on them, and then it tires out the old hen, more
than 36 chickens would.</p>

<p>I think this rule works both ways, among poultry, and
among other pholks.</p>

<p>I have seen a hen set on 36 duck eggs, and hatch the whole
ov them out<ins title="Note: “.” in the original" id="cg_43">,</ins> and then try tew learn them tew skratch in the
garden.</p>

<p>But a ducks phoot aint bilt right for skratching in the
ground, it iz better composed for skratching in the water.</p>

<p>When the young ducks takes tew the water, it iz melankolly,
and hart brakeing, tew see the old hen, stand on the
brim ov the mil pond, and wring her hands, and holler tew
the ducks, tew come right strate out ov that water, or they
will all git drowned.</p>

<span id="pg_123" class="page_anchor">123 </span>

<p>I have seen this did too, but i never see the ducks come
out till they got reddy, nor never see a young duck git
drowned.</p>

<p>Yu kant drown a young duck, they will stand az mutch
water az a sponge will.</p>

<p>One egg, per diem, iz all that a hen ought to lay, espeshily
nu beginner, but there iz sum smart writers on the subjekt,
who claim they ought
tew lay two.</p>

<p>This needs more
testimony.</p>

<p>Az an artikle ov
diet, thare is but
phew things that surpass
cooked hen, if
eaten in the days ov
their youth and innosense,
but after they
git old, and kross,
they kontrakt a habit
ov eating tuff.</p>

<p>After thinking the
thing over, and over,
and over, I am still
prepared tew say,
that a hen is a darn phool, ennyhow you kan fix it.</p>

<p>I don’t speak of this as enny disgrace two the hen, it only
shows that natur dont even make a phool without a destiny.</p>

<p>Az long as hens phill their destiny, eggs won’t git tew be
worth over 25 cents a dozen, and broiled chicken will be one
ov the luxurys ov life.</p>

<p>Thare iz grate proffit, and sum loss, in razeing chickens,
the <i>loss</i> iz the heavyest when sum boddy brakes into the
chicken coop, and steals all the chickens.</p>

<p>Thare iz a grate menny breeds ov hens, just now, but the
old-fashioned speckled hen breed iz the most flattering.</p>

<span id="pg_124" class="page_anchor">124 </span>

<p>After they hav laid an egg, they aint afraid tew say so,
and kan outkackle all other breeds ov hens, and when yu
come tew scratching up a garden, they are wuth two ov enny
other kind.</p>

<p>I dont kno ov enny sight that pleases me more than tew
see an old speckled hen cum sputtering oph from her nest
and pitch, feet fust, into a new made garden.</p>

<p>I suppoze if I owned the garden this thing might not look
so phunny tew me, but yu see, I dont own enny garden.</p>

<p>I belong tew that misfortunate klass ov real estate men
who dont own enny garden, and I have sumtimes wondered
if it want just about az proffitable for me tew enjoy the
skratching up ov the garden, and let them other folks who
own the hens and the garden do their own gitting mad and
swearing.</p>

<h2 id="sec-50">THE GOTE.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> gote iz a koarse wollen sheep.</p>

<p>They hav a split hoof and a whole tail.</p>

<p>They hav a good appetite, and a sanguine digestion.</p>

<p>They swallo what they eat, and will eat ennything they kan
bite.</p>

<p>Their moral karakters are not polished, they had rather steal
a rotten turnip, out ov a garbage-box, than tew cum honestly
bi a pek ov oats.</p>

<p>The male gote haz two horns on the ridge ov hiz hed, and
a mustash on hiz bottom lip, and iz the plug ugly ov hiz naberhood.</p>

<p>A maskuline gote will fite ennything, from an elephant down
to hiz shadder on a ded wall.</p>

<p>They strike from their but-end, insted ov the shoulder, and
are az likely tew hit, az a hammer iz a nailhed.</p>

<p>They are a hi seazoned animal, az mutch so az a pound ov
assifidity.</p>

<span id="pg_125" class="page_anchor">125 </span>

<p>They are faithful critters, and will stick tew a friend az long
az he livs in a shanty.</p>

<p>They kan klime ennything but a greast pole, and kno the
way up a rock, az natral az a woodbine.</p>

<p>They are az certain tew raize az yung ones, sum familys
are haff gotes, and the other haff children. They are good
eating when they are yung, but they leave it oph az they git
stronger.</p>

<p>They are alwus poor in the boddy, but phatt in the stumick,
what they eat seems to all go to appetight, yu mite az well
agree tew phatt an injun rubber over shew bi filling it with
klam shells, az tew raize enny adipoze membrane on the outside
bust ov a gote.</p>

<p>A phatt gote would be a literary curiosity.</p>

<p>They use the same dialekt az the sheep, and the yung ones
speak the language more fluently than the parients do.</p>

<p>Thare iz only two animals ov the earth that will eat tobakko—one
iz a man and tuther iz a gote, but the gote understands
it the most, for he swallers the spit, chaw and all.</p>

<p>The male gote, when he iz pensiv, iz a venerable and philosophy
looking old cuss, and wouldn’t make a bad proffessor ov
arithmetik in sum ov our colleges.</p>

<p>They are handy at living a longtime, reaching an advanced
age without arriving at enny definite konklusion.</p>

<p>How long a gote livs without giving it up, thare iz no man
now old enuff tew tell.</p>

<p>Methuzeler, if hiz memory waz bad at forgetting, mite giv
a good-sized guess, but unfortunately for science and this essa,
Methuzeler aint here.</p>

<p>Gotes will liv in enny klimate, and on enny vittles, except
tanbark, and if they ever cum to a square death, it iz a profound
sekret, in the hands of a few, to this day.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t like tew beleave enny man under oath who had
ever seen a maskuline gote acktually die, and stay so.</p>

<p>Speaking ov Methuzeler, puts me in mind ov the fackt, if
a man should liv now daze, as mutch az he did, and only hav
one eye tew see things with, he would hav to hav an addishun
bilt onto the back ov hiz head tew sto away things into.</p>

<span id="pg_126" class="page_anchor">126 </span>

<p>The femail gote iz either the mother, or sister, or cuzzin ov
the male gote, ackording tew the prevailing circumstansis in
the case, or else i labour under a delusion, i forget witch.</p>

<p>They giv milk intuitively about a quart, before it iz watered,
in twelve hours, which iz the subjickt ov nourishment in various
ways.</p>

<p>This milk, whitch is extrakted from the female gote, iz
excellent tew finish up yung ones on, but is apt to make them
bellycose, and fightful.</p>

<p>It iz not unkommon for a babe, while inhaleing this pugnashus
fluid, to let oph hiz left colleckshun or diggit and ketch
the nurse on the pinnakle ov the smeller, and tap it for claret.</p>

<p>This iz a kommon fakt amung irish babes, and explains the
reazon whi, in after life, these same babes make such brilliant
hits.</p>

<p>In writing the history ov the male and female gote tew
adorn the pages ov futer times, i flatter miself that i hav stuck
tew the truth, and haven’t allowed mi imaginashun tew boss
the job.</p>

<p>A grate menny ov our best bilt historians are apt tew mistake
opinyuns for facts, this iz an eazy mistake tew make,
but when i strike a goose, or bed bugg, or gote, yu notis one
thing, i stay with them.—Finis.</p>

<p>The gosling iz the

<p>The goose don’t

<p>They seem tew lack

<p>They are good eating,
but not good chawing;
the reason ov this
remains a profound sekret

<p>When the femail
goose iz at work hatching,
she iz a hard bird tew please; she riles clear up from the
bottom in a minnit, and will fight a yoke ov oxen, if they
show her the least bit ov sass. The geese iz excellent for
feathers, which she sheds every year by the handful.</p>

<p>They are also amphibicuss, besides several other kinds ov
cuss.</p>

<p>But they are mostly cureiss about one thing: they kan

akount, but sits still, and keeps watch with hiz mouth, for
sumthin tew cum along.</p>

<p>Hiz temper iz sed tew be cold and clammy, but he must
hav a relish for sumthing, for hiz mouth waters aul the time.</p>

<p>Thare iz nothing more docile than the clam, and altho they
sumtimes git into a stew, they are az eazy tew lay yure hand
on, and ketch, az a stun, but they are like an injun, not very
talky; they hav got an impediment in their noize; their lips
open with too much titeness, and their mouth iz tew full ov
tongue tew be glib.</p>

<p>Clams were fust diskovered, az the meazles waz, by being
caught. How long a clam kan live I don’t beleaf they kan
tell themselfs, probably 5 thousand years, but a large share

<p>The striped snake iz one ov the slipperyest jobs that natur
ever turned loose.</p>

<p>They travel on the lower side ov themselfs, and kan slip
out ov sight like blowing out a kandle. They were made for
sum good purpose, but i never hav bin informed for what,
unless it waz tew hav their heds smashed.</p>

<p>They are sed tew be innocent, but they hav got a bad reputashun,
and all the innocence in the world won’t kure a bad

<p>They liv in the grass but seldom git stept on, bekauze they
don’t stay long enuff in the right place.</p>

<span id="pg_130" class="page_anchor">130 </span>

<p>When i waz a little boy, and wore naked feet, and waz loafing
around loose for strawberrys, i waz often times just a going
tew step on a striped snaik, but it alwus cured me ov
strawberrys.</p>

<p>If a striped snaik got into a 10-aker lot before i did, i alwus
konsidered that all the strawberrys in that lot belonged tew
the snaik.</p>

<p>“Fust cum, fust sarve,” was mi motto.</p>

<p>I am just az fraid ov snaiks now az i waz 40 years ago, and
if i should liv tew be az old az Nebudkennezer waz, and go tew
grass as he did, one striped snaik would spile 50 akers ov good
pasture for me.</p>

<p>Wimmin don’t luv snaiks enny more than i do, and i respekt
her for this.</p>

<p>How on earth Eve waz seduced by a snaik, iz a fust class
mistery tew me, and if i hadn’t read it in the bible, i would
bet aginst it.</p>

<p>I beleave everything thare iz in the bible, the things i kant
understand, I beleave the most.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t swop oph the phaith i hav got for any living
man’s knoweledge.</p>

<p>Snaiks are all sorts, and all sizes, and the smaller they are,
the more i am afrade ov them.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t buy a farm at haff price that had a striped snaik
on it.</p>

<p>Ded snaik are a weakness with me; i always respekt them,
and whenever i see a ded one in the road, i dont drop a tear on
him, but i drop another stone on him, for fear he might alter
his mind and cum tew life agin, for a snaik hates tew die just
az much az a kat duz.</p>

<h3 id="sec-53-2">BABYS.</h3>

<p>Babys i luv with all mi heart; they are mi sweetmeats, they
warm up mi blood like a gin sling, they krawl into me and
<span id="pg_131" class="page_anchor">131 </span>
nestle by the side ov mi soul, like a kitten under a cook stove.</p>

<p>I hav raized babys miself, and kno what i am talking about.</p>

<p>I hav got grandchildren, and they are wuss than the fust
krop tew riot amung the feelings.</p>

<p>If i could hav mi way, i would change all the human beings
now on the face ov the earth back into babys at once, and
keep them thare, and make this footstool one grand nussery;
but what i should do for wet nusses i don’t kno, nor don’t
care.</p>

<p>I would like tew have 15 babys now on mi lap, and mi lap
ain’t the handyest lap in the world for babys, neither.</p>

<p>My lap iz long enuff, but not the widest kind ov a lap.</p>

<p>I am a good deal ov a man, but i konsist ov length principally,
and when i make a lap ov miself, it iz not a mattrass,
but more like a couple ov rails with a jint in them.</p>

<p>I can hold more babys in mi lap at once, than any man in
Amerika, without spilling one, but it hurts the babys.</p>

<p>I never saw a baby in mi life that i didn’t want tew kiss; i
am wuss than an old maid in this respekt.</p>

<p>I hav seen babys that i hav refused tew kiss untill they had
been washt; but the baby want tew blame for this, neither
waz i.</p>

<p>Thare are folks in this world who say they don’t luv babys,
but yu kan depend upon it, when they waz babys sumboddy
loved them.</p>

<p>Babys luv me, too. I kan take them out ov their mothers’
arms just az eazy az i kan an unfleged bird out ov hiz nest.
They luv me bekauze i luv them.</p>

<p>And here let me say, for the comfort and consolashun ov
all mothers, that whenever they see me on the cars or on the
steambote, out ov a job they needn’t hesitate a minnit tew
drop a clean, fat baby into mi lap; i will hold it, and kiss it,
and be thankful besides.</p>

<p>Perhaps thare iz people who don’t envy me all this, but it
iz one ov the sharp-cut, well-defined joys ov mi life, mi love
for babys and their love for me.</p>

<p>Perhaps thare iz people who will call it a weakness, i don’t
<span id="pg_132" class="page_anchor">132 </span>
care what they call it, bring on the babys. Unkle Josh haz
always a kind word and a kiss for the babys.</p>

<p>I love babys for the truth thare iz in them, i aint afraid
their kiss will betray me, their iz no frauds, ded beats nor
counterfits among them.</p>

<p>I wish i was a baby (not only once more) but forever-more.</p>

They aint afrade tew bite a sawlog, or a black bear. They
are born in the water, but they kan live out doors on the
land as long az they kan find ennything tew bite.</p>

<p>They hav several leggs, which are aul lokated on the starboard
side ov their person. Crabs liv under cover, like the
mud turtles, but they move evry fust ov May, into a new one.</p>

<p>They are sed tew be good eating, but you wouldn’t think
so tew stand and look at them; it would bother a stranger
tew tell where tew begin; it would be a good deal like trying
tew make a sudden dinner out ov a kross kut saw.</p>

<p>They are biled in a pot, about 3 bushels ov them, until
they stop biting, and then they are done, and are et by throwing
away the boddy, and sucking the pith out ov the limbs.
It is a good deal like trieng tew get the meat out ov a grasshopper’s
leggs. It is considered a good day’s work to git
one dinner out of biled crabs; I think perhaps a person mite
sustane life on them, but he would hav tew work nite and
day to do it, and keep a smart man biling crabs aul the time.

<p>They never hav enny disseaze but the meazles, and they
never hav that but once; once seems to satisfy them.</p>

<p>Thare iz a grate menny breeds amongst them.</p>

<p>Sum are a close corporation breed, and sum are bilt more
apart, like a hemlock slab.</p>

<p>Sum are full in the face, like a town clock, and some are
az long and lean az a cow-catcher, with a steel pinted noze on
them.</p>

<p>They kan awl rute well; a hog that kant rute well, haz bin
made in vain.</p>

<p>They are a short lived animal, and generally die az soon az
they git fatt.</p>

<p>The hog kan be larnt a grate menny cunning things, such
az highsting the front gate off from the hinges, tipping over
the swill barrells, and finding a hole in the fence to git into
a cornfield<ins title="Note: “,,” in the original" id="cg_44">,</ins> but thare ain’t enny length tew their memory;
it iz awful hard work for them tew find the same hole to git
out at, espeshly if yu are at all anxious they should.</p>

<p>Hogs are very kontrary, and seldom drive well the same
way yu are going; they drive the most the other way; this

then steal into the sitting room, az softly az an undertaker,
and lay themselfs down on the rug, at yure feet, full ov injured
innocence, and

<p>All thare iz, sure

<p>You kant looze a

<p>You may send one

up in a meal bag, and
marked, “C. O. D.,”
and the next morning
yu will find him, or
her, (accordin tew sex) in the same old spot, along side ov the
kitchen stove, reddy tew be stepped on.</p>

<p>Cats hav got two good ears for melody, and often make the
night atmosphear melodious, with their opera musik.</p>

<p>But the most wonderful thing, about a cat, that haz bin diskovered
yet, iz their fear ov death.</p>

<p>Yu kant induce one, by enny ordinary means, to accept ov
death,—they aktually skorn tew die.</p>

<p>You may kill one, az much az yu hav a mind to, and they
will begin life anew, in a few minnitts, with a more flattering
prospektus.</p>

<p>Dogs i love, they carry their kridenshuls in their faces, and
kant hide them, but the bulk ov cats reputashun lays buried
in their stumuk, az unknown tew themselfs, az tew enny boddy
else.</p>

<p>Thare iz only one thing, about, that i like, and that iz, they

summer, and it want a fust rate night for cats neither.</p>

<p>The Kangaroo is an overgrown monkey. They are fello-citizens
ov Afrika, and spend most ov their lezzure moments
on foot. They hav four legs, but their fore legs aint ov mutch
use to them; they do most ov their acktual bizzness with their
hind legs. They travel a good deal az a frog duz—on the
jump.</p>

<p>Kangarooes are verry valuabel in their plase, and Afrika iz
the plase for them. I hav thought if the whole ov Afrika
had been planted with Kangaroos, and none ov it with other
peeple, it would hav been full as good a crop to know what
to do with.</p>

<p>Kangaroos liv upon roots, gras, and herbs, and kan outjump
ennything in the wilderness. In the face they resemble the
deer, but in the length ov their tails they resemble a whole
herd ov deer.</p>

<p>A kangaroo’s tail iz a living kuriosity; in its general
habits it looks and akts like a rat’s tail, but in size you must
multiply it by six thousand and upwards.</p>

<p>What on arth a kangaroo wants so mutch tail for haz bothered
the philosophers for ages, and i understand, that lately,
at one ov their scientifick meetings they hav giv it up.</p>

<p>The philosophers git beat oftener than ennybody i kno ov,
but they seldom giv a thing up; but the kangaroo’s tail waz
too mutch for them.</p>

<p>But a kangaroo’s tail don’t bother me enny more than a
kite’s tail duz; a bob-tailed kangaroo on the jump would akt
just as a bob-tailed kite duz in the air. Whenever i cum
acrost ennything in natur that i kant explain, then i kno at
once that it iz all right for natur never made enny blunders
in the animals; if she has failed ennywhare, it iz in man.</p>

<span id="pg_136" class="page_anchor">136 </span>

<p>Natur gav man reazon, and showed him how to use it, but
man luvs to open the throttle valve and let reazon hum. This
ackounts for hiz running oph from the track so often and gitting
bust up. I never knu a kangaroo tew bust up.</p>

<h2 id="sec-57">THE CODFISH.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> codfish iz a child ov the oshun. This ackounts for
their being so salt.</p>

<p>They are caught with a hook and line, and bite a steel
trap, and hang on like a poor relation.</p>

<p>They are good eating for a wet day; they are better than
an umbreller to keep a man dry.</p>

<p>Dried codfish iz one ov the luxurys of life, but codfish
three times a day would weaken mi confidence in them.</p>

<p>Codfish never venture in fresh water; they would soon
spile if they did.</p>

<p>I never hav been codfishing miself, but think I should like
it better than fishing for frogs.</p>

<p>I think i could ketch frogs well enuff, but i should insist
upon their taking themselfs off from the hook.</p>

<p>I had rather take a boss bumble bee in mi hand than a
live frog, not bekause I am afraid the frog would bite, but i
am afraid ov their kicking.</p>

<p>Sum people ain’t afraid to take ennything with their hands,
that they can reach, not even an eel, but if I should ever git
caught by an eel, if i couldn’t settle with him, right off, by
giving him the hook and line, i would throw the pole into
the bargin and put for home.</p>

<p>The codfish iz sed tew be an aristokrat, and to keep aloof
from the other fish of hiz size in the sea, and claims tew be a
relation of the whales, but this looks to me rather fishy.</p>

<p>I hav noticed that the codfish alwus haz a stiff upper lip,
but I think this iz more owing tew the bone that iz in him
than it iz tew his blood.</p>

<p>They are very eazy to bite, and are caught with a piece ov
old red flannel pettycoat tied onto a hook.</p>

<p>They ain’t the only kind ov fish that are caught by the
same kind of bait.</p>

<p>Mackrel inhabit the sea, but thoze which inhabit the grocerys
alwus taste to me az tho they had been born and fatted
on salt.</p>

<p>They want a good deal ov freshning before they are eaten,
and want a good deal ov freshning afterward.</p>

<p>If I can hav plenty of mackrel for brekfasst i can generally
make the other two meals out ov cold water.</p>

<p>Mackrel are considered by menny folks the best fish that
swims, and are called “the salt of the earth.”</p>

<h2 id="sec-59">THE POLLYWOGG.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> pollywogg iz created bi the sides ov the road, out ov
thick water, and spends hiz infancy in pollywogging.</p>

<p>After he haz got through pollywogging he makes up hiz
mind that this world want made for pollywogs and “nothing
venture nothing have,” and then he turns hiz attenshun tew
bigger things.</p>

<p>He looks out upon life with the eye ov wisdum, and studdying
the various animals ov creashun, he cums tew the konklusion
that the best thing he kan do iz tew bekum a frog.</p>

<p>This iz the way that frogs fust cum tew be made, and pollywoggs
tew be lost.</p>

<p>The pollywogg now leaves the water and spends a part ov
hiz summers upon land.</p>

<p>He haz tew fite hiz way through life, and generally goes
on the jump.</p>

<p>Being better at diving than he iz at dodgeing, he often
<span id="pg_138" class="page_anchor">138 </span>
runs hiz hed aginst sticks and stuns that the boys throw at
him, but hiz two mortal enemys are the frenchman and the
striped snaik.</p>

<p>The frenchman iz satisfied with hiz hind leggs, but the
snaik swallows him whole.</p>

<p>I have seen sum good time made by the frog, and the
snake, the snake after the frog, and the frog after dear life.</p>

<p>If the frog kan only reach a tree, and klimb it, he iz safe,
for a snake kant travel a tree.</p>

<p>I don’t kno az the pollywogg gains ennything by swopping
himself oph for a frog, unless it iz experience, but i never
hav bin able to diskover much ov enny happiness in experience.</p>

<p>If experience ever made a man happy, i should hav happiness
to sell, for I am one ov them happy phellows who never
found ennything (not even the bite ov a lobster) only through
the kindness of experience.</p>

lizzards and dirt.</p>

<p>They hav no taste to their mouths, and never spit out ennything
that they kan swallo.</p>

<p>They have two ugly black thorns sticking out on the sides
ov their hed, and are az dangerous tew handle az a six-bladed
penknife, with the blades all open to onst.</p>

<p>They are like a kat, yu hav got to skin them before they
are fit to eat, and after they are thoroughly cooked, if yu set
them away in the cupboard until they git cold, they will begin
life anew, and bekum az raw az a live mule.</p>

<p>They will liv, after they are ded az long az striped snaik kan.</p>

<p>I don’t advise enny man to fish for bull heads, but if yu
feel az tho yu must, this iz the only best way to do it.</p>

<span id="pg_139" class="page_anchor">139 </span>

<p>Take a dark, hot, drizzly night in the month ov june; steal
out quietly from home; tell yure folks yu are going tew the
nabors to borry a setting of hen’s eggs; find a saw log on the
banks ov a stagnant mill-pond, one end of which lays in the
water; drive the mudturkles and water snaiks oph from the
log; straddle the log, and let yure leggs hang down in the
water up tew yure garters; bait yure hook with a chunk ov
old injun rubber shoe; az fasst az yu pull up the bull heads,
take them by the back ov the neck and stab their horns onto
the saw log; when yu hav got the saw log stuck full, shoulder
the saw log, and leave for home; git up the next morning
early, skin the bull heds, and split up the saw log into kindling
wood, let yure wife cook them for brekfast, and sware
the whole family to keep dark about it.</p>

sum eggs, which tha lay in sum warm sand, and ginerally
hav them hatched out tew the halves. Tha belong tew the
class known az “close korporashuns,” and are a hard animil
tew whip, bekause tha alwus fite under cover. The mudturkle
kant climb very well, and therefore seldum iz found up a

rubber shoe, and don’t seem tew gro old enny faster than a
paving stone duz. Tha kan be domestikated without enny

tho tha cant trot as fast az sum hosses kan, thare sure tew git

I take a deep interest in moste awl the animils, and particularly
in mudturkles, and i dew hope that the Legislature in
their wisdum won’t pass a law “prohibiting enny more mudturkles.”
I regret tew hear, that in sum parts ov the kuntry,

az the wind duz,
“whare it listeth.”</p>

<p>How they are exactly
born, i haven’t
been able yet tew investigate,
but they are
so universal at times,
that i hav thought,
they didn’t wait tew
be born, but took the
fust good chance that
was offered, and cum
just az they am.</p>

<p>They are sed tew be
male and femail, but
i dont think they konsider
the marriage tie
binding, for they look
so mutch alike, that it
would be a grate waste ov time, finding out wich waz who,
and this would lead tew never ending fites, wich iz the rhubarb
ov domestik life.</p>

<span id="pg_141" class="page_anchor">141 </span>

<p>They make their annual visit about the first ov May, but
don’t git tew buzzing good till the center ov August.</p>

<p>They stay with uz untill kold weather puts in an appearance,
and then leave, a good deal az they cum, jist az they am.</p>

<p>Menny ov them are kut oph in the flower ov their yuth, and
usefullness, but this don’t interfere with their census, for their
iz another steps right into their place, and heirs their property.</p>

<p>Sum looze their lives bi lighting too near the rim ov a toad’s
noze, and fall in, when the tud gaps, and others git badly
stuck bi phooling with mollassis.</p>

<p>Sum visit the spiders, and are induced tew remain, and
thousands find a watery grave, bi gitting drowned in milk
cans.</p>

<p>The fly iz no respekter ov pussuns, he lights onto the pouting
lips ov a sleeping darkey, jist az eazy az he duz onto the buzzum
ov the queen ov buty, and will buzz an Alderman, or a
hod-carrier, if they git in his way.</p>

<p>Flys, moraly konsidered, are like a large share ov the rest
ov human folks, they wont settle on a good healthy spot in a
man, not if they kan find a spot that iz a leetle raw.</p>

<p>Their principal food iz every thing, they will pitch into a
ded snaik, or a quarter ov beef, with the same anxiety, and
will eat from sun rise, till seven o’clock in the evening, without
getting more than haff phull.</p>

<p>They will eat more, and hold less, than enny bug we kno
ov.</p>

<p>The fly haz a remarkable impoverished memory, yu may
drive him out ov yure ear; and he will land on yure forhed,
hit him aginly, and he enters yure noze, the oftner yu git
rid ov him in one spot, the more he gets onto another; the
only way tew inculcate him with yure meaning, iz tew smash
him up fine.</p>

<p>Naturalists dont tell us all about the soshull habits ov the
fly, but i beleave they hav temprate habits, and altho they
hang around grocerys a good deal, I never saw a fly the wuss
for liquor, but i hav often seen liquor the wuss for flies.</p>

<span id="pg_142" class="page_anchor">142 </span>

<p>They hav a big appetight for gitting into things, they are
the fust at the dinner table, and alwus take soup, and dont
leave untill the cloth iz removed.</p>

<p>Flys see a grate deal ov good sosiety, they are admitted into
all circles, and if they remember one haff that they see and
hear, what a world ov phunny sekrets they could unfold; but
flys are perfekly honarable, and never betray a konfidence.</p>

<p>What would sum lovers giv, if they could only git a fly tew
blab, but a fly iz a perfek gentleman, he eats oph from your
plate, enjoys yure conversashun, sees sights, and haz more
phun, and privilege, than a prime minister, or a dressing maid,
but when yu cum tew pump him, he iz az dry in the mouth,
az a salt codfish.</p>

<p>Thare iz sumthing a fly will blow, but he wont blow a sekret.</p>

<p>Flys i think, must be born whole, for i never saw a haff
born fly, they are all ov a size when yu fust see them, like a
paper ov pins, and never git enny smaller.</p>

<p>I dont kno ov a more happy, whole souled, honest critter,
among the bug dispensation, than a hansum, square bilt fly,
taking a free ride in central park, with the Mayor and hiz
wife, or a free lunch at Delmonico’s, with the minister from
England, and then finishing up the bizzness ov the day, by
sleeping upside down, on the ceiling ov my ladys bed chamber.</p>

<p>But thare iz plenty ov pholks who kant see enny phun, or
religion in a fly, whoze whole aim iz tew set molasses traps
for them, tew chase them out ov the house with a sled stake,
and then clear across a ploughed lot onto the next farm, tew
git up nights in their stocking feet, tew worry them, with the
tongs, tew drive them tew the brink ov despair, and finally
ruin them, with deth.</p>

<p>I thank the Lord i ain’t one ov thoze, i don’t luv a fly enuff,
tew leave mi vittles, and fall down flatt on mi stummuk, and
worship them, but a fly may cum and sit on mi noze, all day,
and chaw hiz cud in silence, if he will only sit still.</p>

<p>Flys tickle me, but they don’t make me sware, it takes a

on a dog’s noze, and then creeps az soft az a shadder, on tew

what they kan steal, and they will steal enny thing that aint

<p>They are fond ov meat vittles, and are the first tew hold

a fine bird tew hunt, but a hard one tew kill; they kan see

<p>They bild their nest among a tree, and lay twice, and both
eggs would hatch out if they was laid in a snow bank,—thare

<p>Crows are very lengthy; i beleave they live always i never

<h2 id="sec-66">THE SWALLO.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> swallo iz a lively bird.</p>

<p>Swallows make their appearance late in the spring, and
alwus in a twitter about sumthing.</p>

<p>They hav az mutch twitter, as a boarding skool miss.</p>

<p>They kan fli az swift az an arrow, and a great deal crookider.</p>

<p>I have seen them skim a mill pond, cluss enuff tew take
the cream off from it, and even make the frogs dodge, and
not touch the water.</p>

<p>When the swallo cums, spring haz cum sure, but thare iz
an old proverb, (one ov Solomans, i presume,) which sez,
“one swallo dont make a spring.”</p>

<p>This may be so, but i have seen a spring (ov water), that
would make a grate menny swallows.</p>

<p>Swallows never hav the dispepshy, they liv upon nothing,
and take a grate deal ov exercise in the open air.</p>

<p>They dont set up nites busting, and never cheat a taylor
out ov hiz bill.</p>

<p>They dont waste enny time in the morning making their
toilett, but like the flowers, shake oph the dew from their
heds, and are reddy for bizzness.</p>

<p>I kant think ov enny thing God has made, more harmless
than a swallo, they are as innosent az a daizy, and az pure as
the air they swim in, they wont live, shut up in a cage, mutch
longer, than a trout will.</p>

<p>They dont seem tew be bird, beast, nor insek, but a kind of

<p>If thare want enny bats in this world, i dont suppose the
earth would refuse tew revolve on its axis, once in a while,
just for fun.</p>

<p>But when we cum to think, that thare aint on the face ov
the earth, even one bat too mutch, and that thare haint been,
sintz the daze ov adam, a single surpluss muskeeters egg,
laid by acksident, we kan form sum kind ov an idea, how little

the machinery of kreashun.</p>

<p>Man iz a phool enny how, and the best ov the joke iz, he
don’t seem tew kno it.</p>

<p>Bats hav a destiny tew fill, and i will bet 4 dollars, they fill
it better than we do ours.</p>

<p>Bats liv on flies, and hawks liv on bats, but who livs on the
hawks, i kant tell.</p>

<p>Biled hawk may be good, i never herd enny boddy say it
wasn’t, but i dont hope i shall ever be called upon tew decide
it.</p>

<p>Tew save life, i would eat biled hawk, but if it tastes az i

<p>They bild their nests out ov the reach ov civilizashun, so

that no mishionary kan git to them, unless he kan klimb well.</p>

<p>Powder and double B shot, iz the only thing that will civilize
a hawk clear through, so that he will stay so, and it takes
a big charge ov this too.</p>

<p>I have fired a double-barrelled gun into them, loaded with
fine shot, and it had the same exilirating effekt on them, that
4 quarts ov oats would hav, on an old hoss, it made them
more lively for a fu minnits.</p>

<p>I hav seen ded hawks, but i never shed enny tears over

<h2 id="sec-70">THE POSSUM.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> possum iz a fello ov the Southern and Western States.
He owns a sharp noze, a keen eye, a lean head, a phat
boddy, and a poor tail.</p>

<p>He enjoys roots, chickens, grass, eggs, green korn, and little
mice, and eats what he steals, and steals what he eats.</p>

<p>Hiz boddy is kivvered with a hairy kind ov phur, ov a
dirty white complexion; hiz feet and fingers resemble the <ins title="Note: “rackkoon” in the original" id="cg_45">rackoon</ins>,
hiz ears are a trifle smaller than the mules, and hiz tail
iz az round az an eel, and az free from capilliaryness as the
snaiks stummuk.</p>

<p>The possum’s tail bothers me. I hav looked at it bi the hour;
i hav studdyed it, and tried tew parse it; i hav figgered on it
az cluss az i would a proposishun in Euklid; i hav hung over
it az fondly az a kemist; i hav fretted and wondered, hav got
mad, wept and swore, and kant tell to this day whi a possum
should hav a hairless caudel.</p>

<p>If some philosophik mind, out ov a present job, will explain
this tale to me, and sho me the mercy ov it, i will explain to
him, free from cost, the pucker ov the persimmon, or the vital
importance thare iz in being bolegged, two misterys which are
only known to the Billings family.</p>

<p>The possum iz a lonesum and joyless vagabond, living just
near enuff to the smoke ov a chimbly tew pick up a transient
goslin or a ten dollar bill, or ennything else that aint stuck
fast.</p>

<p>Thare iz only one man in this visionary world who seems
tew hav an affinity, ov a moral natur, for the possum, and that
<span id="pg_150" class="page_anchor">150 </span>
iz a darkey. They are the nigger’s poultry and roast lamb.</p>

<p>The possum, in poor condishun, is az phull ov phatt as a
tallo kandle in the month ov august, but having et possum
miself, and biled awl from necessity, i am full ov the opinyun
that between the two mi choice would be never agin to take
either.</p>

<p>Possums alwus hav twins when they hav ennything, and
sumtimes an extra one, and they suckle their yung on an entire
different principal from the goose.</p>

<p>Their skins are a subject of traffick, and are worth in market
from nine to ten cents a piece, provided the tail is amputated.
A possum’s tail iz not only worthless, but iz a damage
to any enterprizing man.</p>

<p>Theze skins are colored and made into mink muffs, and sold
for twenty-five dollars a head, tew thoze whoze early edukashun
has bin neglekted.</p>

<p>Thare iz only one thing about a possum’s skin different from
a hoss hide, they don’t shed their hair, evry hair is drove in
and clinched on tuther side.</p>

<p>Possum’s hav butiful white natral teeth, and their mouth iz
az full ov them az a kow hide boot iz ov shu pegs.</p>

<p>But say what yu will about theze comick geniuses ov natur,
they hav got two things that they own and no other animul,
feathered, or hairy, possesses them so mutch.</p>

<p>I mean tuffness and cunning.</p>

<p>If a possum thinks he kant reach hiz hole, in the hollo ov
the tree, tew eskape a wandering dog or a stray nigger, he
lays himself down level on the opposite side ov hiz belly, and
dies az ded az a two dollar watch.</p>

<p>The dog will smell ov hiz corpse and pass on, the nigger
will rool him over, pheal ov hiz phatt, and konkluding that
“dis possum hab been eating pizen;” take him by the tail
and send him buzzing into a brush heep.</p>

<p>Many a possum haz saved hiz life, and hiz phatt, bi thus
loozeing it.</p>

<p>I hav often killed them with a klub, sufficiently dead enuff
tew bury, and hiding behind a tree, fur a fu minnitts, hav
<span id="pg_151" class="page_anchor">151 </span>
seen them born agin, and sneak oph into the underbrush.</p>

<p>If thare iz enny boddy who don’t beleave this i don’t care,
i only write what i know, and don’t hold miself liable for
other folks’ ignorance.</p>

<p>Possum grease and hoe kake, in equal parts, will phatt a nigger
in 60 days, and make hiz face glisten like a piece ov pattent
leather.</p>

<p>If the possum only had hare on the tail i could account for
him fully, but this lack ov the hirsute attachment bothers me.</p>

<p>I think now i would giv ten dollars tew be made well on
this subjeckt.</p>

<p>Altho the possum dies hard, he lives eazy, and i might az
well own it, forever, for i have spent a great quantity ov mi
life surrounded by possums and other historick vermin, and
never heard only ov acksident death in the possum family.</p>

<p>The muskrat and the possum hav similar tales, but the
muskrat steers himself with hiz while bathing, but the possum
never bathes in ennything but chicken blood.</p>

<p>The studdy ov natur iz a good risk to take, and will make
sum men az phull ov knowledge az an unabridged Webster’s
spellin book, while thare iz others that natur nor ennyboddy
else haint bin able tew edukate yet.</p>

<p>They gro thare verry spontaneous, and the market for

<p>Two hundred and fifty to the square inch iz konsidered a

<p class="caption">THE CURSID MUSKETO.</p>
</div>

<p>The musketer iz a short lived bug, but don’t waste enny
time; they are alwuss az reddy for bizzness az pepper sass iz,
and kan bight 10
minnitts after they
are born just az fluently
az ever.</p>

<p>Thare iz people
in this world so kontrary
at heart, and
so ignorant, that
they wont see enny
wisdum in having
musketers around;
i alwus pitty sutch
pholks—their edukashun
haz been
sorely neglekted and
aint level.</p>

<p>Wisdum iz like
duks eggs—if yu git
them, yu hav got
tew sarch for them—thare
aint no duks in theze benighted days that will cum
and la eggs in yure hand—not a duk, Mr. ——, not a duk.</p>

<p>The musketo is a soshul insex; they liv verry thick
amungst each other, and luv the sosiety ov man also, but don’t
kontrakt enny ov hiz vices.</p>

<p>Yu never see a musketer that was a defaulter; they never
fail to cum to time, altho thousands looze their lives in the
effort.</p>

<p>The philosophers tell us that the muskeeters who can’t sing
won’t bight; this information may be ov grate use to science,
but aint worth mutch to a phellow in a hot nite whare muskeeters
are plenty.</p>

<span id="pg_153" class="page_anchor">153 </span>

<p>If thare ain’t but one musketer out ov ten that kan bight
good, that iz enuff to sustain their reputashun.</p>

<p>The philosophers are alwus a telling us sumthing that iz
right smart, but the only plan they kan offer us tew get rid
ov our sorrows iz to grin and bear them.</p>

<p>They kant rob one single musketer ov hiz stingger by argument.
I say bully for the muskeeter!</p>

<p>The muskeeter iz the child ov circumstansis in one respekt—he
can be born, or not, and liv, and die a square deth in a
lonesum marsh, 1600 miles from the nearest nabor, without
ever tasting blood, and be happy all the time; or he kan git
into sumboddy’s bed-room thru the key-hole, and take hiz
rashuns reglar, and sing sams ov praze and glorificashun.</p>

<p>It don’t kost a muskeeter mutch for hiz board in this world;
if he kant find enny boddy to eat he kan set on a blade ov
swamp meadow gras and liv himself to deth on the damp
fog.</p>

<p>The musketo is a gray bug and haz 6 leggs, a bright eye, a
fine busst, a sharp tooth and and a reddy wit.</p>

<p>He dont waste enny time hunting up hiz customers, and
alwus lights onto a baby fust if thare iz one on the premises.</p>

<p>I positively fear a musketo.</p>

<p>In the dark, still nite, when every thing iz az noizeless az
a pair ov empty slippers, to hear one at the further end ov
the room slowly but surely working hiz way up to yu, singing
that same hot old sissing tune ov theirs, and harking to
feel the exackt spot on yure face whare they intend tew lokate,
iz simply premeditated sorrow tew me; i had rather look forward
to the time when an elephant waz going tew step onto
me.</p>

<p>The musketo haz no friends, and but phew associates; even
a mule dispizes them.</p>

<p>But i hav seen human beings who want aktually afraid ov
them; i hav seen pholks who had rather hav a muskeeter lite
onto them than to have a trakt peddler lite onto them; i hav
seen pholks who were so tuff aginst anguish that a muskeeter
mite lite onto them enny whare and plunge their dagger in
up tew the hilt in vain.</p>

<span id="pg_154" class="page_anchor">154 </span>

<p>I envy these people their moral stamina, for next tew being
virtewous i would like tew be tuff.</p>

<p>This life iz phull ov pesky muskeetos, who are alwus a looking
for a job, alwus reddy tew stik a thissell into yu sum
whare, and sing while they are doing it.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. ——, pardon me for saying so mutch about the
cursid muskeeto, but ov all things on this arth that travel, or
set still, for deviltry, thare aint enny bug, enny beast, or enny

<h2 id="sec-72">THE HORNET.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> hornet is an inflamibel bugger, sudden in hiz impresshuns
and hasty in hiz conclusion, or end.</p>

<p>Hiz natral disposishun iz a warm cross between red pepper
in the pod and fusil oil, and hiz moral bias iz, “git out ov mi
way.”</p>

<p>They hav a long, black boddy, divided in the middle bi a
waist spot, but their phisikal importance lays at the terminus
ov their subburb, in the shape ov a javelin.</p>

<p>This javelin iz alwas loaded, and stands reddy to unload at
a minnit’s warning, and enters a man az still az thought, az
spry az litening, and az full ov melankolly az the toothake.</p>

<p>Hornets never argy a case; they settle awl ov their differences
ov opinyun bi letting their javelin fly, and are az certain
tew hit az a mule iz.</p>

<p>This testy kritter lives in congregations numbering about
one hundred souls, but whether they are male and female, or
conservative, or matched in bonds ov wedlock, or whether
they are Mormons, and a good menny ov them klub together
and keep one husband tew save expense, i dont kno nor dont
kare.</p>

<p>I never hav examined their habits mutch, i never considered
it helthy.</p>

<span id="pg_155" class="page_anchor">155 </span>

<p>Hornets bild their nests whenever they take a noshun to,
and seldom are disturbed, for what would it profit a man tew
kill 99 hornets and hav the one hundredth one hit him with
hiz javelin?</p>

<p>They bild their nests ov paper, without enny windows to
them or back doors. They hav but one place ov admission,
and the nest iz the shape ov an overgrown pine-apple, and iz
cut up into just az menny bedrooms az thare iz hornets.</p>

<p>It iz very simple tew make a hornets nest if yu kan, but i
will argue enny man 300 dollars he kant bild one that he
could sell tew a hornet for half price.</p>

<p>Hornets are az bizzy az their second couzzins, the bee, but
what they are about the lord only knows, they dont lay up
enny honey, nor enny money, they seem tew be bizzy only
jist for the sake ov working all the time, they are alwus in
az mutch ov a hurry az tho they waz going for a doktor.</p>

<p>I suppose this uneazy world would grind arownd on its axletree
onst in 24 hours, even if thare want enny hornets, but
hornets must be good for sumthing, but i kant think now
what it iz.</p>

<p>Thare haint been a bug made yet in vain, nor one that want
a good job, thare iz ever lots ov human men loafing around
black smith shops, and cider mills, all over the country, that
dont seem tew be necessary for ennything but tew beg plug
tobacco and swear, and steal water-melons, but yu let the
cholera brake out once, and then yu will see the wisdum ov
having jist sich men laying around loose, they help count.</p>

<p>Next tew the cockroach, who stands tew the hed, the hornet
haz got the most waste stummuk, in reference tew the
rest ov hiz boddy, than enny ov the insek populashun, and
here iz another mistery: what on arth duz a hornet want so
mutch reserve corps for.</p>

<p>I hav jist thought—tew carry hiz javelin in, thus you see,
the more we diskover about things the more we are apt to
know.</p>

<p>It iz alwus a good purchase tew pay out our last surviving
dollar for wisdum, and wisdum iz like the misterious hens egg,
<span id="pg_156" class="page_anchor">156 </span>
it aint laid in yure hand, but iz laid away under the barn, and
yu hav got tew sarch for it.</p>

<p>The hornet iz an unsoshall kuss, he iz more haughty than
he iz proud, he iz a thorough bred bug, but hiz breeding and
refinement haz made him like sum other folks i kno ov, dissatisfied
with himself, and everyboddy else, too mutch good
breding ackts this way sumtimes.</p>

<p>Hornets are long-lived—i kant state jist how long their
lives are, but i kno, from instinkt and observashun, that enny
kritter, be he bug or be he devil, who is mad all the time, and
stings every good chance he kan git, gennerally outlives all his
nabers.</p>

<p>The only way tew git at the exact fiteing weight ov the
hornet, is tew tutch him, let him hit you once with his javelin,
and you will be willing tew testify in court that sumboddy
run a one-tined pitchfork into yer; and az for grit, i will
state for the informashun ov thoze who haven’t had a chance
tew lay in their vermin wisdum az freely az i hav, that one
single hornet, who feels well, will brake up a large camp
meeting!</p>

<p>What the hornets do for amuzement iz another question i
kant answer, but sum ov the best read, and heavyest thinkers
amung the naturalists say they hav target excursions, and
heave their javelins at a mark; but i don’t imbibe this assershun
raw, for i never knu enny boddy, so bitter at heart az
the hornets are, to waste a blow.</p>

<p>Thare iz one thing that a hornet duz that i will giv him
credit for on mi books—he alwus attends tew hiz own bizzness,
and wont allow any boddy else tew attend tew it, and
what he duz iz alwuz a good job, you never see them altering
enny thing, if they make enny mistakes, it iz after dark, and
aint seen.</p>

<p>If the hornets made haff az menny blunders az the men do,
even with their javelins, everyboddy would laff at them.</p>

<p>Hornets are clear in another way, they hav found out, bi
trieing it, that all they kan git in this world, and bragon, iz
their vittles, and clothes, and yu never see one, standing at
<span id="pg_157" class="page_anchor">157 </span>
the corner ov a street, with a twenty-six inch face on, bekauze
sum bank had run oph, and took their money with
him.</p>

<p>In ending oph this essa, i will cum tew a stop, by concluding,
that if hornets waz a leetle more pensive, and not so
darned peremptory with their javelins, they might be guilty ov
less wisdum, but more charity.</p>

<p>But yu kant alter bug natur, without spileing it for enny
thing else, enny more than yu kan an elephant’s egg.</p>

<p>They are sumtimes white for color, and their hair iz tangled
all over them, like the hed ov a yung darkey.</p>

<p>They are kept az pets, and, like all other pets, are az stubborn
az a setting hen.</p>

<p>A poodle iz a woman’s pet, and that makes them kind ov
sakred, for whatever a woman luvs she worships.</p>

<p>I hav seen poodles that i almost wanted tew swop places
with, but the owners ov them didn’t akt to me az tho they
wanted tew trade for enny thing.</p>

<p>Thare iz but phew things on the face ov this earth more
utterly worthless than a poodle, and yet i am glad thare iz
poodles, for if thare wasn’t thare iz some people who wouldn’t

good for fleas.</p>

<span id="pg_159" class="page_anchor">159 </span>

<p>Fleas are also good for poodles, for they keep their minds
employed scratching, and almost every boddy else’s too about
the house.</p>

<p>I never knew a man tew keep a poodle. Man’s natur iz too
koarse for poodles. A poodle would soon fade and die if a
man waz tew nuss him.</p>

<p>I don’t expekt enny poodle, but if enny boddy duz giv me
one he must make up hiz mind tew be tied onto a long stick
every Saturday, and be used for washing the windows on the
outside.</p>

<p>This kind ov nussing would probably make the poodle mad,
and probably he would quit, but i kant help it.</p>

<p>If i hav got tew keep a poodle, he haz got tew help wash
the windows every Saturday. I am solid on this pint.</p>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> <ins title="Note: “partridge” in the original" id="cg_46">patridge</ins> iz a kind ov wild hen, and liv in the swamps,
and on the hill sides that are woody.</p>

<p>They are verry eazy tew ketch with the hand, if yu kan git
near enuff tew them tew put salt on their tale, but this iz alwus
diffikult for nu beginners.</p>

<p>In the spring ov the year they will drum a tune with their
wings on some deserted old log, and if yu draw ni unto them
tew observe the musik, they will rize up, and kut a hole thru
the air with a hum like a bullet.</p>

<p>Thare iz no burd kan beat a patridge on the wing for one
hundred yards, i am authorized tew bet on this.</p>

<p>The patridge are a game burd, and are shot on the wing,
if they are not missed.</p>

<p>It iz dreadful natral tew miss a patridge on the fly, especially
if a tree gets in the way.</p>

<p>I hav hunted a grate deal for patridge, and lost a grate deal
ov time at it.</p>

<span id="pg_160" class="page_anchor">160 </span>

<p>The patridge lays 14 eggs, and iz az sure tew hatch all her
eggs out az a cockroach iz who feels well.</p>

<p>When a brood ov yung patridges fust begin tew toddle about
with the old bird, they look like a lot ov last year’s chestnut
burs on legs.</p>

<p>Broiled patridge iz good if yu kan git one that waz born
during the present century, but thare iz a grate menny patridge
around that waz with Noah in the ark, and they are az
tuff tew git the meat oph ov az a hoss shu.</p>

<p>But broiled patridge iz better than broiled krow, and i
had rather hav broiled krow than broiled mule just for a
change.</p>

<p>They are pure game, and are shot on the move.</p>

<p>They are az tender tew brile az a saddle rok oyster, and
eat az eazy az sweetmeats.</p>

<p>The snipe haz a long bill (about the length ov a doktor’s)
and git a living bi thrusting it down into the fat earth, and
then pumping the juices out with their tounge.</p>

<p>I hav seen snipe so phatt that when they waz shot 50 feet
in the air and phell on to the hard ground, they would split
open like an egg.</p>

<h2 id="sec-77">THE COCKROACH.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> cockroach iz a bug at large.</p>

<p>He iz one ov the luxurys ov civilization.</p>

<p>He iz eazy to domestikate, yielding gracefully to ordinary
kindness, and never deserting thoze who show him proper
ackts ov courtesy.</p>

<span id="pg_161" class="page_anchor">161 </span>

<p>We are led to beleave, upon a cluss examination ov the
outward crust ov these fashionable insekts, that they are a
highly successful intermarriage between the brunette pissmire,
and the “<i>artikilus bevo</i>” or common Amerikan grasshopper.</p>

<p>Naturalists however differ, which iz to be lamented, for a
diversity ov sentiment, upon matters so important to the
peace ov mind and moral advancement ov mankind in the
lump, creates distrust, and tends to sap the substrata ov all
bug ethicks.</p>

<p>But let the learned and polite pull hair az mutch az they
pleaze about the ansestral claims ov the cockroach it iz our
bizzness and duty, az bug scrutinizer, tew show the critter up
az we find him, without caring a single, solitary curse, who
hiz grandfather or grandmother acktually waz.</p>

<p>Thare iz no mistaking the fackt that he iz one ov a numerous
family, and that hiz attachment tew the home ov hiz boyhood,
speaks louder than thunder for hiz affecktionate and unadulterated
natur.</p>

<p>He dont leave the place he waz born at upon the slightest
provocation, like the giddy and vagrant flea, or the ferocious
bed bugg, and untill death, (or sum vile powder, the invenshun
ov man) knocks at hiz front door, he and hiz brothers
and sisters may be seen with the naked eye, ever and anon
calmly climbing the white sugar bowl or running foot races
between the butter plates.</p>

<p>How strange it iz that man, made out ov dirt, the cheapest
material in market, and the most plenty, should be so determined
to rid the world ov evry living bug but himself.</p>

<p>I dont doubt if he could hav hiz own way for six years,
evry personal cockroach would be knocked off from the
bosom ov the footstool, and not even a pair ov them left to
repair damages with.</p>

<p>Such iz man!</p>

<p>The cockroach is born on the fust ov May and the fust ov
November semiannually, and is reddy for use in fifteen days
from date.</p>

<p>They are born from an egg, four from each egg, and consequently
<span id="pg_162" class="page_anchor">162 </span>
they are all ov them twins. There is no such thing
in the annals ov natur as a single cockroach.</p>

<p>The maternal bug don’t sett upon the egg as the goose
doth, but leaves them lie around loose, like a pint ov spilt
mustard seed, and don’t seem tew care a darn whether they
get ripe or not.</p>

<p>But I never knew a cockroach egg fail tew put in an
appearance. They are as sure tew hatch out and run as
Kanada thistles, or a bad kold.</p>

<p>The cockroach is ov tew colours, sorrel and black. They
are always on the move, and kan trot, I should say, on a good
track, and a good day, cluss tew three minnitts.</p>

<p>Their food seems tew consist, not so mutch in what they
eat as what they travel, and often finding them dead in
my soup at the boarding-house, I hav cum to the conclusion
that a cockroach kan’t swim, but they kan float.</p>

<p>Naturalists hav also declared that the cockroach has no
double teeth. This is an important fackt, and ought tew be
introduced into all the primary school books ov Amerika.</p>

<p>But the most interesting feature ov this remarkable bugg
is the lovelyness ov their natures. They kan’t bite nor sting,
nor skratch, nor even jaw back. They are so amable that I
hav even known them tew get stuck in the butter, and lay
there all day, and not holler for help, and aktually die at last
with a broken heart.</p>

<p>To realize the meekness ov theze uncomplaining little cusses,
let the philosophick mind just for one moment compare them
to the pesky flea, who light upon man in hiz strength and
woman in her weakness like a red hot shot, or to the warbling
musketo, wild from a Nujersey cat-tail marsh, with hiz
dagger in hiz mouth ackeing for blood; or, horror ov horrors!
to the midnight bed bugg, who creeps out ov a crack az still
and az lean az a shadow, and hitches on to the bosom ov buty
like a starved leech.</p>

<p>Every man haz a right to pick hiz playmates, but az for
me, i had rather visit knee deep among cockroaches than to
hear the dieing embers ov a single muskeeter’s song in the
<span id="pg_163" class="page_anchor">163 </span>
room jineing, or to know that thare waz just one bedbugg
left in the world and he waz waiting for mi kandle to go out
and for me to pitch into bed.</p>

<p>In conclusion, to show that I aint fooling, i would be willing,
if I had them, to swap ten fust class fleas any time for a
small sized cockroach, and if the fellow complained that I
had shaved him in the trade, I would return the cockroach
and sware that we waz even.</p>

<p>You kan

a medder jineing, and let them jump out.</p>

<p>Tha are reddy for use, just as soon as they will du tu

<p>Tha haint got enny friends, and will live on huckle berry
brush, with an ockasional chanse at Kanada thistels.</p>

<span id="pg_164" class="page_anchor">164 </span>

<p>Tha are a modern invenshun, i dont think the Bible deludes

<p>Tha sel for more money than enny other domestik animile.

<p>Tha are like sum men, verry korrupt at harte; ive known
them tu be good mules for 6 months, just tu git a good chanse
to kick sumbody.</p>

<p>I never owned one, nor never mean to, unless thare is a
United Staits law passed, requiring it.</p>

<p>The only reason why tha are pashunt, is bekause tha are
ashamed ov themselfs.</p>

<p>I have seen eddikated mules in a sirkus.</p>

<p>Tha kould kick, and bite, tremenjis. I would not sa what
I am forced tu sa again the mule, if his birth want an outrage,

<p>Enny man who is willing tu drive a mule, ought to be exempt

<p>Tha are the strongest creeturs on earth, and heaviest

it was absolutely convenient.</p>

<h2 id="sec-79">BED BUGS.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">I</span> never</span> see ennybody yet but what despised <i>Bed Bugs</i>.
They are the meanest ov aul crawling, creeping, hopping,
or biteing things.</p>

<p>They dassent tackle a man bi dalite, but sneak in, after
dark, and chaw him while he iz fast asleep.</p>

<span id="pg_165" class="page_anchor">165 </span>

<p>A musketo will fight you in broad dalite, at short range,
and giv you a chance tew knock in hiz sides—the flea iz a
game bugg, and will make a dash at you even in Broadway—but
the bed-bugg iz a garroter, who waits till you strip, and
then picks out a mellow place tew eat you.</p>

<p>If i was ever in the habit ov swearing, i wouldn’t hesitate
to damn a bed bugg right tew hiz face.</p>

<p>Bed bugs are uncommon smart in a <i>small</i> way; one pair
ov them will stock a hair mattrass in 2 weeks, with bugs enuff
tew last a small family a whole year.</p>

<p>It don’t do enny good to pray when bed bugs are in season;
the only way tew git rid ov them iz tew bile up the whole
bed in aqua fortis, and then heave it away and buy a new
one.</p>

<p>Bed buggs, when they hav grone aul they intend to, are
about the size ov a bluejay’s eye, and hav a brown complexion,
and when they start out to garrote are az thin az a grease
spot, but when they git thru garroting they are swelled up
like a blister.</p>

<p>It takes them 3 days tew git the swelling out ov them.</p>

<p>If bed buggs have enny destiny to fill, it must be their
stummuks; but it seems tew me that they must hav bin made
by acksident, jist az slivvers are, tew stick into sumboddy.</p>

<p>If they waz got up for sum wise purpose, they must hav
took the wrong road, for there kant be enny wisdum in
chawing a man aul night long, and raising a family, besides,
tew foller the same trade.</p>

<p>If there iz sum wisdum in aul this, I hope the bed buggs
will chaw them folks who kan see it, and leave me be, bekause
i am one ov the hereticks.</p>

<h2 id="sec-80">THE FLEA.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> smallest animal ov the brute creashun, and the most
pesky, iz the <i>Flea</i>.</p>

<p>They are about the bigness ov an onion seed, and shine like
a bran new shot.</p>

<span id="pg_166" class="page_anchor">166 </span>

<p>They spring from low places, and kan spring further and
faster than enny ov the bug-brutes.</p>

<p>They bite wuss than the musketoze, for they bite on a run;
one flea will go aul over a man’s subburbs in 2 minnitts, and
leave him az freckled az the meazels.</p>

<p>It iz impossible to do ennything well with a flea on you,
except sware, and fleas aint afraid ov that; the only way iz
tew quit bizzness ov aul kinds and hunt for the flea, and when
you have found him, he ain’t thare. Thiz iz one ov the flea
mysterys, the fackulty they hav ov being entirely lost jist as
soon as you hav found them.</p>

<p>I don’t suppose thare iz ever killed, on an average, during
enny one year, more than 16 fleas, in the whole ov the United
States ov America, unless thare iz a cazualty ov sum kind.
Once in a while thare iz a dogg gits drowned sudden, and
then thare may be a few fleas lost.</p>

<p>They are about az hard to kill az a flaxseed iz, and if you
don’t mash them up az fine az ground pepper they will start
bizzness agin, on a smaller kapital, jist az pestiverous az ever.</p>

<p>Thare iz lots ov people who have never seen a flea, and it
takes a pretty smart man tew see one ennyhow; they don’t
stay long in a place.</p>

<p>If you ever ketch a flea, kill him before you do ennything
else; for if you put it oph 2 minnits, it may be too late.</p>

<p>Menny a flea haz past away forever in less than 2 minnits.</p>

kant kiver but 3 ov them—the rest stand around on the outside,
like boys around a cirkus tent, gitting a peep under the

ought tew own them all and be obliged tew feed them on
grasshoppers, caught bi hand.</p>

<p>I never owned but one and he got choked tu deth bi a kink

<p>Not enny shanghi for me, if yu pleze; i wuld rather board

owl rare dun, or a turkee buzzard, roasted hole, and stuffed
with a pair ov injun rubber boots, but not enny shanghi for
me, not a shanghi!</p>

<p>Speaking ov hens, leads me tew remark, in the fust place,
that hens, thus far, are a suckcess.</p>

<p>They are domestick, and occasionally are tuff.</p>

<p>This iz owing tew their not being biled often enuff in their
younger daze; but the hen ain’t tew blame for this.</p>

<p>Biled hen iz universally respekted.</p>

<p>Thare iz a grate deal ov originality tew the hen—exactly
how mutch i kant tell, historians fight so mutch about it.
Sum say Knower had hens with him in the ark and sum say
he didn’t. So it goes, which and tuther.</p>

<p>I kant tell yu which waz born fust, the hen or the egg;
sumtimes i think the egg waz—and sumtimes i think the
hen waz—and sumtimes i think i don’t kno, and i kant tell
now, which way iz right, for the life ov me.</p>

<p>Laying eggs iz the hen’s best grip.</p>

<p>A hen that kant lay eggs—iz laid out.</p>

<p>One egg iz konsidered a fair day’s work for a hen. <ins title="Note: “i” in the original" id="cg_47">I</ins> hav
herd ov their doing better, but i don’t want a hen ov mine
tew do it—it iz apt tew hurt their constitution and bye-laws,

<p>The poet sez, butifully:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“Sumboddy haz stole our old blew hen!</div>
<div class="line2">I wish they’d let her bee;</div>
<div class="line">She used tew lay 2 eggs a day,</div>
<div class="line2">And Sundays she’d lay 3.”</div>
</div>

<span id="pg_169" class="page_anchor">169 </span>

<p>This sounds trew <ins title="Note: “euuff” in the original" id="cg_48">enuff</ins> for poetry, but i will bet 75 thousand
dollars that it never took place.</p>

<p>The best time tew sett a hen, is when the hen is reddy.</p>

<p>I kant tell you what the best breed is, but the shanghigh
is the meanest. It kosts as mutch tew board one, as it duz a
stage hoss, and yu mite as well undertake tew fat a fanning-mill,
by running oats thru it.</p>

<p>Thare aint no proffit in keeping a hen for his eggs, if he
laze less than one a day.</p>

<p>Hens are very long lived, if they dont contrakt the thrut
disseaze,—thare is a grate menny goes tew pot, evry year, bi
this melankolly disseaze.</p>

<p>I kant tell exactly how tew pick out a good hen, but as a
general thing, the long-eared ones, are kounted the best.</p>

<p>The one-legged ones, i kno, are the lest ap tew skratch up
a garden.</p>

<p>Eggs packed in equal parts ov salt, and lime water, with
the other end down, will keep from 30, or 40, years, if they
are not disturbed.</p>

<p>Fresh beef-stake is good for hens; i serpose 4 or 5 pounds
a day, would be awl a hen would need, at fust along.</p>

<p>I shall be happee tew advise with yu, at enny time, on the

the rest ov the job.</p>

<p>He probably would hav objekted to having enny little bizzy
aunts at all, and various other objekshuns would hav bin
offered, equally green.</p>

<p>I am glad that man waz the last thing made.</p>

<p>If man hadn’t hav bin made at all, you would never hav
heard me find enny fault about it.</p>

<p>I haven’t much faith in man, not bekauze he kant do well
but bekauze he wont.</p>

<p>Ants hav bye laws, and a constitushun, and they mean sumthing.</p>

<p>Their laws aint like our laws, made with a hole in them, so
that a man kan steal a hoss and ride thru them on a walk.</p>

<p>They don’t hav enny whisky ring, that iz virtewous, simply,
bekauze it hooks bi the millyun, and then legalizes its own
ackts.</p>

<p>They don’t hav enny legislators that yu kan buy, nor enny
judges, laying around on the haff shell, reddy tew be swallered.</p>

<p>I rather like the aunts, and think now I shall sell out mi
money and real estate, and jine them.</p>

<p>I had rather jine them than the bulls or the bears, i like
their morals better.</p>

<p>The bulls and the bears handle more money, it iz true, and
make a grate deal more noize in Wall street, one ov them
sticking his horn into a flabby piece ov Erie and tossing it up
into the air, and the other ketching it when it cums down,
and trampling it under hiz paws.</p>

<span id="pg_172" class="page_anchor">172 </span>

<p>This may be phun for the bulls and the bears, but it iz
wuss than the cholera morbust for poor Erie.</p>

<p>Ants never disturb Erie; yu couldn’t sell one eny Erie,
enny more than you could sell one skrip on the cod-fish banks
ov Nufoundland.</p>

<p>Ants are a honest, hard-tugging little people, but whether
they marry, and giv in marriage, iz beyond my strength; but
if they don’t they are no wuzz oph than they are out west
(near the city of Chicago), where they marry to-day and apply
for an injunkshun to-morrow; and are reddy the next
day to fite it out agin on sum other line.</p>

<p>Wedlok out west (near the grate grain mart Chicago) iz
one ov them kind ov locks that almost enny boddy kan pick.</p>

<h2 id="sec-83">SUM SNAIX.</h2>

<h3 id="sec-83-1">THE ADDER.</h3>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> adder iz az spotted az a checker-board, and are very
butiful tew admire at a propper distance oph.</p>

<p>They hav a koal blak eye, which revolves on its axis, and
shines like a glass bead.</p>

<p>They kan be found in wet places, and are handy tew liv,
both down in the water, and up on the top ov the land. They
kan slip oph from an old bridge, or a log, into a mill pond,
az natral, and az eazy, az a pint ov turpentine, and kno how
tew swim, and wave, on the brest ov sum water like the shaddo
ov the weeping willo.</p>

<p>They are harmless tew bight, but one adder, would spile
all the bathing thare waz in a mill pond for me, when i waz
a boy.</p>

<h3 id="sec-83-2">THE STRIPED SNAIK.</h3>

<p>The striped snaix is one ov the garden varietys. They inhabit
door yards, and stun heaps down at the foot ov the garden,
and piles ov old boards, and weedy spots, and grass generally.</p>

<span id="pg_173" class="page_anchor">173 </span>

<div class="illustration" id="ill-28">
<a href="images/ill-29.jpg"><img src="images/ill-29_min.jpg" alt="THE INFANT HERCULES"></a>
</div>

<p>They are the domestik snaik, if thare iz enny such thing,
and are really az
harmless az an old
garter, but az full
ov fraid tew almost
every boddy, az a
torpedo.</p>

<p>The fust snaix, we
hav enny ackount
ov much, waz the
devil, surnamed
bellyzebubb, who
wiggled his way into
the Garden of
Eden, and without
a single trump in
hiz hand, beat our
two original ansesstors,
out ov joy inneffible,
and glory
halleluyer forever,
and gave them in exchange for it sorrow without stint, and
wo unutterabel. This was an unkommon poor trade for the
human family. All snaiks are sneaks, and steal around on
their slippry stummuks, az still, and greazy, az lamp ile.</p>

<p>Snaix kant stand the enkroachments ov civilizashun, the
seed ov the woman iz alwus after them with a long pole,
and a man, post haste for a doktor, will alwuss dismount, and
hich hiz animile hoss, tew put an extra hed onto a snaix.</p>

<p>This kind ov treatment has alwus made snaiks raizing a
dredful risky bizzness teu follow.</p>

<p>Out ov one thousand snaixs born annually, the staytisstix
sho 930 ov them die in a grate hurry, espeshily whare
churches and school houses flourish.</p>

<p>I don’t kno ov a more unhelthy spot in the world for a
snaix teu settle down and undertaik teu bring up a family
than near a distrikt school house.</p>

<span id="pg_174" class="page_anchor">174 </span>

<p>Let enny body just holler “<i>striped snaix</i>” once, near a
distrikt school house, and you will see the snaix begin teu
paddle, and the young ones begin tew bile out like hornets out
ov their nest, and proceed for that snaix like a flok of young
turkeys for a Junebug.</p>

<p>Striped snaiks are about two feet and one haff in length,
and about one inch in diameter, and “thareby hangs a tail.”</p>

<h3 id="sec-83-3">THE BLUE RACER.</h3>

<p>The blue racer is a Western snaik, about 6 feet in length,
ov a pale blue color, and the smartest snaix, for suddenness, in
the universe.</p>

<p>They kan run, on a unmown meaddo, as fast as ahoss, with
their heds about 2 foot high, and their whole boddy bileing
with muscles.</p>

<p>They are az harmless az a rabbit, and will run if you chase
them, and then will turn and chase you, if you want them tew
play “<i>tag</i>.”</p>

<p>They are froliksom cusses, but I never did hanker for sitch
kind of refreshments.</p>

<p>They are the nicest kind ov a mark to shoot at.</p>

<p>Draw a fine sight on their heds when they hold up abov
the turf, and let them hav one barrell ov number 6 shot, and
the hed will be missing, and the ballance ov the snaix will be
looking after the hed in a grate hurry, turning all sorts of
back summersets and double and twisted bo knots, and hirogliphick
kontortions for 20 minutes, before they make up
their mind that it is safe tew die.</p>

<p>It is a dredful krewel sight tew see them ketch a frog,
it iz alwus done on a run, and done quick, for the poor
frog don’t stand enny more chance ov getting away than a
chesnutt tree duz when lightning fires up, and goes for it.</p>

<p>They swallo the frog whole, and stik out with a frog in
them like a yung purp who haz allowed a quart ov buttermilk
tew find its way into him.</p>

<h3 id="sec-83-4">THE BLAK SNAIK.</h3>

<p>The blak snaix iz the only one i kno ov who kan klimb a
<span id="pg_175" class="page_anchor">175 </span>
tree without boosting, and take the yung birds out ov their
nests oph from the topmost limb.</p>

<p>They are az handy in a tree top az a yung munkey, but are
not pizon tew bight.</p>

<p>They hav a festive way ov choking things tew death by
making a cravat ov themselfs around the thruts ov their victims.</p>

<p>I hav herd ov wicked children being killed in this way, but
never knu a boy who tended Sunday skool regular, and who
want sassy tew hiz grandfather, and who didn’t eat enny
green apples, and hav the stummuk ake in consequents, to
get choked bi a blak snaix.</p>

<p>Wicked little boys, who pla marbles on Sunday, and who
say “<i>Go up, old bald hed</i>,” and who put kittens into tar barrels
will make a note ov this.</p>

<p>The blak snaix iz about 5 feet in length, and sumtimes
haz a white ring around hiz nek.</p>

<p>There iz very little poetry in snaix ov enny kind, untill
they git their heds smashed, and here iz just whare the poetry
comes in.</p>

<p>There ain’t much poetry in me, but if I waz called upon
tew write an obituary notiss for the whole race ov snaix, who
lay dead in one pile, i would take oph mi coat, rool up mi
sleeves, and saliva mi hands, and rite sum verses that i
wouldn’t be ashamed ov enny how, for i should expekt the
solemnity ov the ockashun would help me out ov the skrape.</p>

<h3 id="sec-83-5">THE MILK SNAIK.</h3>

<p>The milk snaix hangs around pasture lots, and iz said tew
fasten onto the udders ov the cows, and git hiz milk puntch
in this underhand way.</p>

<p>I don’t beleave this, but in writing the biography ov snaix
no man iz obliged tew tell the whole truth about them enny
how.</p>

<p>Fish and snaix are two things that authors are apt tew
consider the fackts ov when they write onto them.</p>

<p>I never knu a man yet, not even of fust rate judgment,
<span id="pg_176" class="page_anchor">176 </span>
if he should ketch a fish that weighed 4 pounds but would
guess he weighed 6, and if he should kill a snaix that was 5
feet, and three inches long, would want tew sware he waz 14
foot long, without taking the krooks out ov him.</p>

<p>This iz human natur, and human natur is heavy on a marvel.</p>

<p>The Bible sez, “<i>marvel not</i>,” and altho i look upon all
things in the Bible with the utmost venerashun, I hav wondered
if Joner’s ketching the whale just az he did, wasn’t
some kind ov authority for the fish storys ov the present
daze.</p>

<p>If a man in theze times should ketch a whale az Joner did,
he would write an ackount ov it, and travel around the kuntry
and lektur onto it, and when he deskribed the size ov that
whale, if a man wan’t smart in figgures, he would git a poor
idea of the animile’s dimenshuns.</p>

<p>I never have saw a milk snaix yet, and if i phool mi <i>life</i>
away, and don’t never see one, I don’t intend tew mourn inkonsolably
about it.</p>

<p>I hav alreddy seen all the snaix I want to, and wouldn’t go
a haff a mile from here to see all the snaix on the buzzum ov
the earth unless thare waz a bonfire ov them.</p>

<p>Snaix ov all kinds hav got but one destiny tew fill, and
Divine Providence haz fixt that; it is tew git their heds
squeezed by a suitable sized pebble.</p>

<h2 id="sec-84">THE RACCOON, AND THE PETTYFOGGER.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> Raccoon iz a resident of the United States ov America;
he emigrated tew this country, soon after its diskovery
by Columbus, without a cent, and nothing but hiz claws tew
git a living with.</p>

<p>He iz one ov them kind ov persons whoze hide iz worth
more than all the rest ov him.</p>

<p>He resides among the heavy timber, and cultivates the
<span id="pg_177" class="page_anchor">177 </span>
cornfields and nabring garden sass for sustenance, and understands
hiz bizzness.</p>

<p>Hiz family consists ov a wife and three children, who liv
with him on the inside ov a tree.</p>

<p>He can alwus be found at home during the day, reddy tew
receive calls, but his nights are devoted tew looking after hiz
own affairs.</p>

<p>He dresses in soft fur, and hiz tail, which iz round, haz
rings on it.</p>

<p>Theze rings are ov the same material that the tail iz, and
are worn upon all occasions.</p>

<p>During the winter he ties himself up into a hard not and
lays down by hiz fireside.</p>

<p>When spring opens, he opens, and goes out tew see how
the chickens hav wintered.</p>

<p>Hiz life iz as free from labor az a new penny, and if it
wasn’t for the dogs and the rest ov mankind, the rackcoon
would find what everyboddy else haz lost—a heaven upon
earth.</p>

<p>But the dogs tree him and the men skin him, and what
there iz left ov him ain’t worth a cuss.</p>

<p>He iz not a natral vagabond like the hedgehog and the
alligator, but luvs to be civilized and liv amung folks; but he
haz one vice that the smartest missionary on earth kan’t
redeem, and that iz the art ov stealing.</p>

<p>He iz seckond only tew the crow in pettit larceny, and
will steal what he kant eat, nor hide.</p>

<p>He will tip over a barrell ov apple sass just for the fun ov
mauling the sass with his feet, and will pull out the plug out
ov the mollassis, not be kause he luvs sugar enny better than
he duz yung duck, but jist tew see if the mollassis haz got
a good daub tew it.</p>

<p>I hav studdied animal deviltry for 18 years, bekause the
more deviltry in an animal, the more human he iz.</p>

<p>I can’t find, by sarching the passenger list, that Noah had
a coon on board, but i am willing tew bet 10 pound ov mutton
<span id="pg_178" class="page_anchor">178 </span>
sassage, that mister coon, and hiz wife were commuted,
by stealing a ride.</p>

<p>I never knu a rackcoon tew want ennything long, that he
could steal quick.</p>

<p>Ennyboddy who haz ever looked a coon, right square in the
face, will bet yu a dollar, that he iz a dead beat, or under five
hundred dollar bonds, not tew go into the bizzness, for the
next ninety days.</p>

<p>I hav had tame coons by the dozzen, they are az eazy tew
tame az a child, if yu take them young enuff, but i kan’t
advise ennybody to cultivate coons, they want az mutch looking
after, az a blind mule on a tow path, and thare aint enny
more profit in them, than thar iz in a stock dividend, on the
Erie Rail Road.</p>

<p>I never waz out ov a pet animal since I kan remember, till
now, but i hav gone out ov the trade forever; lately, i diskovered,
that it waz a good deal like making a whissell out ov
a kats tale, ruining a comfortable tale, and reaping a kursid
mean whissel.</p>

<p>Rackcoons liv tew be 65 years old, if they miss the sosiety
ov men, and dogs enuff, but thare aint but few ov them die
ov old age; the north western fur company, are the grate
undertakers of the coon family.</p>

<p>I feel sorry for coons; for with a trifle more brains, they
would make respectable pettifoggers before a justiss ov the
peace; but even this would not save them from final perdishun.</p>

<p>Natur don’t make any mistakes, after all; she hits the bull
right in the eye every time: when she wants a rackcoon with
rings on hiz tale, she makes him; and when she wants a pettyfogger,
she knows how tew make him, without spileing a good
coon.</p>

<p>Pettyfoggers, no doubt, hav a destiny to fill, and they may
enable a justiss ov the peace, in a cloudy day, tew know a good
deal less ov the law than he otherwize would; still, for all this,
if I war obliged tew pray for one or the other, I think now I
should say, Giv us a leetle more coon, and a good deal less
pettyfogger.</p>

<span id="pg_179" class="page_anchor">179 </span>

<p>If the Raccoon would only giv his whole attenshun tew
politicks, thar ain’t but few could beat him; he is at home on
the stump, and menny on us, <i>old coons</i>, kan reckolekt how, in
1840, with nothing but a hard cider diet, he swept the country,
from the north to the south pole, like a cargo ov epsom
salts.</p>

<h2 id="sec-85">THE FEATHERED ONES.</h2>

<h3 id="sec-85-1">DUK.</h3>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> duk is a foul. Thare aint no doubt about this—naturalists
say so, and kommon sense teaches it.</p>

<p class="caption">THE FEATHERED ONES.</p>
</div>

<p>They are bilt sumthing like a hen, and are an up-and-down,
flat-footed job. They
don’t kackle like
the hen, nor kro
like the rooster, nor
holler like the peakok,
nor scream like
the goose, nor turk
like the turkey; but
they quack like a
root dokter, and
their bill resembles
a vetenary surgeon’s.</p>

<p>They have a woven
fut, and kan float
on the water az natral
az a sope bubble.</p>

<p>They are pretty
mutch all feathers,
and when the
feathers are all removed, and their innards out, thare iz just
about az mutch meat on them az thare iz on a krook-necked
squash that haz gone tew seed.</p>

<span id="pg_180" class="page_anchor">180 </span>

<p>Wild duks are very good shooting, and are very good to
miss also, unless yu understand the bizness.</p>

<p>You should aim about three foot ahead ov them, and let
them fly up tew the shot.</p>

<p>I hav shot at them all day, and got nothing but a tail-feather
now and then; but this satisfied me, for i am crazy for all
kind ov sport, yu know.</p>

<p>Thare are sum kind ov duks that are very hard tew kill,
even if yu do hit them. I shot, one whole afternoon, three
years ago, at sum dekoy duks, and never got one ov them. I
hav never told ov this before, and hope no one will repeat it—this
iz strikly confidenshall.</p>

<h3 id="sec-85-2">TURKEY.</h3>

<p>Roast turkey iz good, but turkey with kranberry sass iz
better.</p>

<p>The turkey iz a sedate person, and seldum forgits herself
by gitting onto a frolik.</p>

<p>They are ov various colors, and lay from 12 to 18 eggs, and
they generally lay them whare noboddy iz looking for them
but themselfs.</p>

<p>Turkeys travel about nine miles a day, during pleasant
weather, in search ov their daily bred, and are smart on a
grasshopper, and red hot on a kriket.</p>

<p>Wet weather iz bad on a turkey—a good smart shower will
drown a yung one, and make an old one look and akt az tho
they had just been pulled out ov a swill barrel with a pair of
tongs.</p>

<p>The maskuline turkey or gobler, as they are familiary
called, hav seazons ov strutting which are immense.</p>

<p>I hav seen them blow themselfs up with sentiments of
pride or anger, and travel around a red flannel petticoat hung
onto a clothes line just az tho they waz mad at the petticoat
for sumthing it had, did, or sed tew them.</p>

<p>The hen turkey alwus haz a lonesum look tew me az tho
she had been abuzed bi sumboddy.</p>

<p>Turkeys kan endure az mutch kold weather az the vane on
<span id="pg_181" class="page_anchor">181 </span>
a church steeple, i hav known them tew roost all night on the
top limb ov an oak tree, with the thermometer 20 degrees
belo zero, and in the morning fly down and wade through
the sno in a barn-yard to cool oph.</p>

<p>P. S.—If you kant hav kranberry with roast turkey, apple
sass will do.</p>

<h3 id="sec-85-3">THE HOSSTRITCH.</h3>

<p>The hosstritch iz a citizen ov the dessart, and lay an egg
about the size ov a man’s hed the next day after he haz been
on a bumming excursion.</p>

<p>They resemble in size, and figger about 15 shanghi roosters
at once, and are chiefly important for the feathers which inhabit
their tails.</p>

<p>The hosstritch are hunted on hossbak, and they kan trot a
mile kluss to 3 minnitts.</p>

<p>They lay their eggs in the sand, and i think the heat ov
the sand hatches them out.</p>

<p>They ain’t bilt right for hatchin out eggs, enny more than
a large-sized figger 4 iz.</p>

<p>I don’t kno whether their eggs are good tew eat or not, but
i guess not for i never have seen ham and hosstritch eggs advertised
on enny ov our fashionable bills ov fare.</p>

<p>Biled hosstritch may be nourishing and may be not; I
think this would depend a good deal upon who waz called
upon tew eat it.</p>

<p>I shan’t never enquire for biled hosstritch az long az i remain
in mi right mind.</p>

<p>If the hosstritch iz a blessing tew the dessert country I
hope they will stay thare, for so long as we hav the turkey
buzzard, and the Sandy Hill Crane, I feel az tho we could
git along, and endure life.</p>

<p>I am writing this essa on the hosstritch a good deal by
guess, for i hav never seen them in their natiff land, nor
never mean to, for jist so long az i kan git 3 meals a day,
and liv whare grass groze, and water runs, i don’t mean tew
hanker for hot sand.</p>

<h3 id="sec-85-4">THE PARROT.</h3>

<p>The parrot iz a bird ov menny colours, and inklined tew talk.</p>

<p>They take holt ov things with their foot, and hang on like
a pair ov pinchers.</p>

<p>They are the only bird i kno ov who kan konverse in the
inglish language, but like meny other nu beginners, they kan
learn tew swear the eazyest.</p>

<p>They are kept az pets, and like all other pets, are useless.</p>

<p>In a wild state ov nature, they may be ov sum use, but
they looze about 90 per cent ov their value by civilizashun.</p>

<p>They resemble the border injun in this respekt.</p>

<p>When yu cum tew take 90 per cent oph from most enny
thing, except the striped snaik, it seems tew injure the proffits.</p>

<p>I owned a parrot once, for about a year, and then gave
him away, i haven’t seen the man I giv him to since, but i
presume he looks upon me az a mean kuss.</p>

<p>If i owned all the parrotts thare iz in the United States, I
would banish them immejiately tew their native land, with
the provizo that they should stay thare.</p>

<p>I don’t make theze remarks tew injure the feelings ov
thoze who hav sot their pheelings on parrotts, or pets ov enny
kind, for i kant help but think that a person who gives up
their time and tallents tew pets, even a sore eyed lap dorg,
displays grate nobility ov karakter. (This last remark wants
tew be took different from what it reads.)</p>

<h3 id="sec-85-5">THE BOBALINK.</h3>

<p>The bobalink iz a blak bird with white spots on him.</p>

<p>They make their appearanse in the northern states about
the 10th ov June, and commence bobalinking at once.</p>

<p>They inhabit the open land, and luv a meadow that iz a
leetle damp.</p>

<p>The female bird don’t sing, for the male makes noize enuff
for the whole family.</p>

<p>They have but one song, but they understand that perfektly
well.</p>

<span id="pg_183" class="page_anchor">183 </span>

<p>When they sing their mouths git az phull ov musik az a
man’s duz ov bones who eats fried herring for brekfast.</p>

<p>Bobolinks are kept in cages, and three or four ov them in
one room make just about as mutch noize az an infant class
repeating the multiplikashun table all at once.</p>

<h3 id="sec-85-6">THE EAGLE.</h3>

<p>Thare iz a grate deal ov poetry in eagles; they kan look
at the sun without winking; they kan split the clouds with
their flashing speed; they kan pierce the blu etherial away
up ever so fur; they kan plunge into midnight’s blak space
like a falling star; they kan set on a giddy krag four thousand
miles hi, and looking down onto a green pasture kan
tell whether a lamb iz phatt enough tew steal or not.</p>

<p>Jupiter, the Peterfunk, god ov the anshunts, had a grate
taste for eagles, if we kan beleave what the poeks sing.</p>

<p>I hav seen the bald-headed eagle and shot them in all their
native majesty, and look upon them with the same kind ov
venerashun that i do upon all sheep stealers.</p>

<span id="pg_184" class="page_anchor">184 </span>
gives out, i shall tap mi imaginashun, ov which i hav a
crude supply.</p>

<p>Book edukashun iz a phatting thing, it makes a man stick
out with other folks opinyuns, and iz a good thing tu make
the vulgar rool up the white ov their eyes, and wonder how
enny man could ever kno so mutch wisdum.</p>

<p>Schooling, when I waz a colt, didn’t lie around so loose az
it duz now, and learning waz picked up oftner by running
yure head aginst a stun wall, than by enny other kind ov
mineralogy.</p>

<p>I have studied botany all day, in a flat meadow, pulling
cowslops for greens, and then classified them, by picking them
over and gitting them reddy for the pot.</p>

<p>All the astronomy i ever got i larnt in spearing suckers bi
moonlite, and mi geoligy culminated at the further end of a
woodchucks hole, espeshily if i got the woodchuck.</p>

<p>Az for moral philosophy and rhetorick, if it iz the science
ov hooking green apples and water-mellons 30 years ago, and
being auful sorry for it now, i am up head in that class.</p>

<p>But all this iz remote from the louse.</p>

<p>The louse iz a familiar animal, very sedentary in hiz habits,
not apt tew git lost. They kan be cultivated without the aid
ov a guide book, and with half a chance will multiply and
thicken az much az pimples on the goose.</p>

<p>Thare iz no ground so fruitful for the full development ov
this little domestick collateral, az a districkt school hous, and
while the yung idea iz breaking its shell, and playing hide and
go seek on the inside ov the dear urchins skull, the louse iz
playing tag on the outside, and quite often gets on to the
school mom.</p>

<p>I hav alwus had a hi venerashun for the louse, not bekause
i consider them az enny evidence of genius, or even neatness,
but becauze they remind me ov my boyhood innocence, the
days away back in the alpahabet ov memory, when i sot on
the flatt side ov a slab bench, and spelt out old Webster with
one hand, and stirred the top ov my head with the other.</p>

<p>Philosophikally handled, the louse are gregarious, and were
<span id="pg_185" class="page_anchor">185 </span>
a complete suckcess at one time in Egypt, bible historians
don’t hesitate tew say, that they were aul the rage at that
time, the whole crust ov the earth simmered and biled with
them, like a pot ov steaming flax seed, they were a drug in
the market.</p>

<p>But this waz more louse than waz necessary, or pleasant,
and waz a punishment for sum sin, and ain’t spoke ov, az a
matter tew brag on.</p>

<p>The louse are all well enuff in their place, and for the sake
ov variety, perhaps a few ov them are just az good az more
would be.</p>

<p>They were desighned for sum wize purpose, and for that
very reason, are respektabel.</p>

<p>When, (in the lapse of time,) it cums tew be revealed to
us, that a single louse, chewing away on the summit ov Daniel
Webster’s head, when he waz a little schoolboy, waz the telegraphick
tutch tew the wire that bust the fust idee in hiz
brain, we shall see wisdom in the louse, and shant stick up
our noze, untill we turn a back summersett, at these venerable
soldjers, in the grand army ov progression.</p>

<p>After we hav reached years ov discretion, and have got our
edukashun, and our karakters have got done developing, and
we begin tew hold offiss, and are elekted justiss ov the peace,
for instance, and don’t seem tew need enny more louse tew stir
us up, it iz time enuff then tew be sassy to them.</p>

<p>Az for me, thare iz only one piece (thus far) ov vital creation,
that i aktually <i>hate</i>, and that iz a bed-bugg. I simply
<i>dispize</i> snaiks, <i>fear</i> musketoze, <i>avoid</i> fleas, don’t <i>associate</i> with
the cockroach, <i>go around</i> toads, <i>back out</i> square for a hornet.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, moreover, to wit, i must say, even at this day
of refinement, and bell letters, i do aktually luv to stand on
tip-toe, and see a romping, red-cheeked, blew-eyed boy, chased
up stairs and then down stair, and then out in the garden, and
finally caught and throwed, and held firmly between hiz
mother’s kneeze, and see an old, warped, fine-toothed horn
comb go and come, half buried through a flood ov lawless
hair, and drag each trip to the light, a fat and lively louse—and,
<span id="pg_186" class="page_anchor">186 </span>
in conclusion, to hear him pop as mother pins him with
her thum nail fast tew the center ov the comb, fills me chuck
up to the brim with something, i don’t know what the feeling
iz; perhaps sumboddy out ov a job can tell me.</p>

<h2 id="sec-87">KATS.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">A</span> kat</span> iz sed to hav 9 lives, but i beleaf they dont hav but
one square deth.</p>

<p>It iz allmost unpossible to tell when a kat iz ded without
the aid ov a koroners jury.</p>

<p>I hav only one way miself to judge ov a ded kat.</p>

<div class="illustration full" id="ill-30">
<a href="images/ill-31.jpg"><img src="images/ill-31_min.jpg" alt=""></a>
<p class="caption">KATS.</p>
</div>

<p>If a kat iz killed in the fall ov the year, and thrown over
the stun wall into yure nabors lot, and lays thare all winter
<span id="pg_187" class="page_anchor">187 </span>
under a sno bank, and dont thaw out in the spring, and keeps
quiet during the summer months, and aint missing when
winter sets in agin, I have alwus sed, that, ‘<i>that kat</i>,’ waz
ded, or waz playing the thing dredful fine.</p>

<p>Speaking ov kats, mi opinyun iz, and will continue to be,
that the old-fashioned kaliko-coulered kats iz the best breed
for a man ov moderate means, who haint got but little munny
to put into kats.</p>

<p>They propugate the most intensely, and lay around the
stove more regular than the Maltese, or the brindle kind.</p>

<p>The yeller kat iz a fair kat, but they ain’t reliable; they
are apt tew stay out late nights, and once in a while git on a
bad bust.</p>

<p>Blak kats hav a way ov gitting on the top ov the wood-house
when other folks hav gone tew bed, and singing dewets
till their voices spile, and their tails swell till it seems az tho
they must split.</p>

<h2 id="sec-88">THE HUM BUGG.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> most vain and impudent bug known to naturalists (or
enny other private individual) iz the hum bugg.</p>

<p>They have no very partickular parents nor birth place, are
born a good deal az tud stools are, wherever they kan find a
good soft spot.</p>

<p>It haz been sed by commontaters that Satan himself iz the
father ov hum buggs—if this iz a fakt he haz got more children
than he kan watch, and sum very fast yung ones amungst
them.</p>

<p>The hum buggs don’t generally live a grate while at once,
but have the fackulty ov dieing in one place, and being suddenly
born in another.</p>

<p>They are ov awl genders, including the maskuline, feminine
and nutral, and kan liv and grow phatt whare an honest bugg
would starve to death begging.</p>

<span id="pg_188" class="page_anchor">188 </span>

<p>The hum bugg will eat enny thing that they kan bite, and
rather than loose a good meal will swaller a thing whole.</p>

<p>Every one sez they dispize the hum bugg and yet every
boddy iz anxious tew make their acquaintance.</p>

<p>They hav the ontra to all cirkles ov sosiety without knocking
from the highest tew the lowest, and tho often kicked out,
are welcumed again and flattered more than ever.</p>

<p>The hum bugg haz more friends than he knows what to do
with, but he manages tew giv general satisfakshun by cheating
the whole of them.</p>

<p>The Bible sez “the grasshopper iz a burden”—and i believe
it—but i think the hum bugg iz the heavyest bug ov
the two.</p>

<p>But the world kant well spare the hum bugg; take them all
out ov the world, and it would bother even an honest man tew
git a living, for thare doesn’t seem, jist now, to be honesty
enuff on hand to do our immense dry good bizzness with.</p>

<p>Honesty iz undoubtedly the best policy for a long run, but
for a short race, hum bugg haz made sum excellent time.</p>

<p>I hav been bit bad bi this bugg miself several times, but
not twice in the same spot—i follow the Skriptures when i
am whare the hum bugg is plenty, if one bites me on one cheek,
i turn him the other cheek also, but i don’t let him bite the
other cheek also.</p>

<p>Thare ain’t enny boddy, i suppose, who acktually pines tew
be bit by this selebrated bugg, they only luv tew see how near
they can cum tew it without missing.</p>

<p>Human natur iz chuck full ov curiosity, curiosity iz jist
what hum bugg makes menny a warm meal oph ov.</p>

<p>Sum ov theze bugg are not so sharp bitten and pizen az
others, but this iz not so mutch owing tew their disposishun
az it iz tew their natur; they all ov them bite the full
length ov their teeth.</p>

<p>If thare iz enny boddy who hain’t never been bit bi a hum
bugg yet, he must be sumboddy who has always staid at home
with his uncle, and, lived on bread and milk, or was born
numb all the way through, and couldn’t feel any kind ov a
bite.</p>

<span id="pg_189" class="page_anchor">189 </span>

<p>If i should hear a man brag that one ov these bugs <i>couldn’t</i>
bite him, I should set him down at once for a man who wan’t
a good judge ov the truth. The bite of a hum bugg iz wuss
than a hornet’s, and always different from a dog’s, for the dog
growls, and then bites, but the hum bugg bites, and lets you
do the growling.</p>

<h2 id="sec-89">THE BUGG BEAR.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">N</span>atral</span> History has its myths and its ghosts, az well az
enny boddy else, and foremost among these iz—the
<ins title="Note: “buggbear” in the original" id="cg_49">bugg bear</ins>.</p>

<p>The bugg bear iz born from an imaginary egg, and iz hatched
by an imaginary process.</p>

<p>They are like a shadow in the afternoon, always a good
deal bigger than the thing that casts it.</p>

<p>They are compozed ov two entirely different animals, the
<i>bugg</i> and the <i>bear</i>, but generally turn out to be pretty much
all bug.</p>

<p>They are like the assetts on a bankrupt broker, the more
you examine them, the smaller they grow.</p>

<p>I have known them tew cum out ov a hole like a mice, and
grow in tew minnits az big az an elephant, and then run back
agin into the same hole they cum out ov.</p>

<p>They are like a young wild pigeon in their habits, the biggest
when they are first born.</p>

<p>They are common to all countrys and all peoples, the philosophers
hav seen them az often az the children hav, and ben
as badly skared by them.</p>

<p>They are az innocent az a rag doll, but are az full ov deviltry
az a jack lantern.</p>

<p>Bugg bears are az plenty in this world az pins on the side
walks, but noboddy ever sees them but those folks who are
alwus hunting for them.</p>

<p>He weighs about 3 pounds and a quarter, more or less,
and iz reddy tew fite for a kingdom. He stands up on hiz

ginger-root, with
each feacher fastened
in its place.</p>

<p>Hiz eye gleams in
its socket like a soltaire

<p>Hiz head iz like

his beak shines like
the point ov a dagger.</p>

<p>When he steps, he
steps like a bunch
ov kat gurt, and hiz
crow iz like the
yung injuns fust
whoop on the warpath.
Hiz plumage
gives back the sun shine like the ruby and amethist, and hiz
legs are all golden.</p>

<p>Hiz gaffs are ov burnt steel, and hiz tail and wing feathers
are clipped for the battle.</p>

<p>Bring on the other rooster.</p>

<h2 id="sec-91">THE DUK.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> Duk iz a kind ov short legged hen.</p>

<p>When cooked they are very good means ov nourishment,
in fakt, it will do to call roste duk and apple sass eazy tew
contend with.</p>

<span id="pg_191" class="page_anchor">191 </span>

<p>The duk haz a big foot for the size ov their boddy, but
their foot iz not the right kind ov a foot for digging in the
garden.</p>

<p>Their foot iz like a small spider’s web, only more substanshul
bilt.</p>

<p>They are amphipicuss, and kan sale on the water az natral
and eazy az a grease spot.</p>

<p>They kan div in the water az handy az a hull frog, and
never git water soaked.</p>

<p>Water won’t stay quiet on a duk’s back no longer than
quicksilver will whare it iz down hill.</p>

<p>Duks hav a broad bill which enables them tew eat their
food without enny spoon.</p>

<p>They are more proffitable tew keep than a hen, bekauze
they kan eat so mutch faster.</p>

<p>Duks are addikted tew a wild state ov natur, but civilizashun
haz did sumthing handsum for duks, and made them
the companyuns ov man and old wimmin.</p>

<p>Next tew her grand children, an old woman thinks most
ov her duks.</p>

<p>The duk iz a good hand tew raze feathers, which groze
all over their person simultanously without enny order.</p>

<p>Thare aint any room on the outside ov a duk for enny
more feathers.</p>

<p>They shed their feathers by having them pulled out, and
these feathers make a good, tuff bed.</p>

<p>A duk’s feather bed iz a good place tew raze nite mares on.</p>

<p>Men often call their wifes their “<i>dear duks</i>,” this is on
ackount ov their big bills.</p>

<p>The duk don’t kro like a rooster, but quaks like a duk.</p>

<p>They do a good deal ov quacking that don’t amount tew
mutch.</p>

<p>Sumtimes doktors are called quacks, but i never hav bin
told whi.</p>

<p>The duk iz not the most profitable bird extant for vittles;
for, when yu hav got oph all the feathers, and pull out their
stummuk, thare aint enny more left on them, than thare iz
on the outside ov an eg shel.</p>

<span id="pg_192" class="page_anchor">192 </span>

<p>They are fust rate feeders, and alwus hav a leetle more
appetight left.</p>

<p>Their leggs are lokated on their boddy like a pair ov hind
leggs, and i hav seen them eat till they tipt over forwards.</p>

<p>Duks ought to hav a pair ov before leggs, and then they
couldn’t eat themselfs oph from their feet.</p>

<p>Duks la eggs, but don’t la them around loose.</p>

<p>Hunting duks’ eggs iz a mitey cluss transackshun.</p>

<p>A man couldn’t earn 30 cents a day and board himself,
hunting duks’ eggs.</p>

<p>The wild duk iz a game bird, and are shot on the wing.</p>

<p>They kan fli next faster tew a wild pigeon, and if yu aim
right at them on the wing, yure shot will hit whare the wild
duk just waz.</p>

<p>I hav seen akres ov them git up oph from the water at
once; they made az mutch noize az the breaking up ov a
kamp meeting.</p>

<p>I hav often fired into them with a dubble-barrelled gun,
when they waz rizing, with both mi eyes shut, and never
injured enny duk, az i kno ov.</p>

<p>I always waz fust rate at missing wild duks on the move.</p>

<p>Sumtimes a duk gits lame, and, when they do, they lay
rite down and giv it up.</p>

<p>Thare ain’t no 2 legged thing on the face ov this earth kan
outlimp a lame duk.</p>

<p>Yu often hear the term “<i>lame duk</i>” applied tew sum men,

<p>He mopes along the brinks ov kreeks and wet places, looking

<p>He haz a long bill, long wings, long legs, and iz long all
over.</p>

<span id="pg_193" class="page_anchor">193 </span>

<p>He iz born ov one egg and goes thru life az lonesum az a

<p>He livs upon lizzards and frogs, and picks up things with
hiz bill az he would with a pair ov tongs.</p>

<p>He sleeps standing like a gide board, and sumtimes tips
over in hiz dreams, and then hiz bill enters the ground like a
pik ax.</p>

<p>When he flies thru the the air, he iz az graceful az a windmill,
broke loose from its fastenings.</p>

<p>Cranes are not very plenty in this world, but the supply,
up tew this date, just about equals the demand.</p>

<p>The crane iz not a good bird for diet; the meat tastes like
injun rubber stretched tight over a clothes hoss.</p>

<p>I never hav et enny crane, nor don’t mean to, untill all the
biled owl in the country givs out.</p>

<p>I kant tell what the Sandy Hill crane waz made for, and it
aint none ov mi bizzness—even a crane from Sandy Hill kan
fill hiz destiny, and praize God loafing along the banks ov a
kreek and spearing frogs for hiz dinner.</p>

<p>I hav spent mutch time among the birds, beasts, and fishes,
and expekt tew spend more, and tho i couldn’t never tell
exackly what cumfort a musketo waz tew the bulk ov mankind,
or what kredit he waz tew himself, i am forced tew
admit that enny thing so perfektly and delikately made iz, to
say the least, a dredful smart job.</p>

<p>Cranes are very long-lived, and are az free from guile az a
bread pill iz.</p>

<p>Cranes seldom git shot. Thare iz two reazons for this;
one iz, they alwus keep gitting a leetle further oph; and the
other iz, thare would be no more kredit for a hunter in bringing
a ded crane home for game than thare would be a yeller dog.</p>

</div>

<p>On the further end ov their boddy they hav sum loose bones,
which they kan play a tune upon, which makes the noize
from which they
take their name
from.</p>

<p>Thare iz only one
remidy for the bite
ov a rattlesnaik that
I kno ov, and that
iz whisky.</p>

<p>I have seen a
man that had bin bit
bi one, drink three
quarts ov whisky,
and be sober enuff
all the time tew jine
the sons ov tempranse.</p>

<p>I hope I never

not so
mutch on ackount
ov the snaik az on ackount ov the whisky.</p>

<p>I think three quarts ov whiskey in mi person at onst would
keep me drunk forevermore.</p>

<p>The grate mortal enemy ov the snaiks iz the hog.</p>

<p>I have seen a woods hog take after a rattlesnaix, and ketch
him in running 50 yards, and with 3 rips and a snatch, tare
mister rattlesnaix into ribbons, and then swallo him whole
without saying grace.</p>

<p>The woods, or wild hog, iz the grate snakes eradikator.
They will hunt for them like a setter dog for a woodkok, and
if the snaix bight them, they hav a way ov laying down in a
mud hole and soaking the pizon all out ov them.</p>

<h3 id="sec-93-2">THE HOOP SNAIK.</h3>

<p>This remarkable snaix haz a funny way ov taking their tail
<span id="pg_195" class="page_anchor">195 </span>
in their mouth and making a hoop ov themselfs. They kan
travel a good gait.</p>

<p>Thare iz a tradishun that the end ov their tale iz ov bone,
and iz filled with pizon, ov the most deadly dimenshuns, but
I think this iz only a lie.</p>

<p>Az I sed before, it iz so natral tew lie about snaix that it
iz a great wonder to me that they don’t leave this world entirely,
and take up their abode sumwhare else, whare they kan
hav a fair show.</p>

<p>I am about 7 eights ov a mind tew beleave that the hoop
snaix iz one ov P. T. Barnum kind ov kritters, that yu pay
yure money tew see in the menagarie, and then take yure
chances.</p>

<p>The only way tew git at the truth about snaix iz to believe
all yu hear, and more too.</p>

<h3 id="sec-93-3">THE ANAKONDY.</h3>

<p>The anakondy iz the grate original land snaix, 365 feet in
length, 4 feet below the eyes, 19 feet in circumference, and
kan swallow an ox whole, if yu will saw hiz horns off.</p>

<p>They kan wind themselfs around the tallest oaks in the
forest, and tare it up bi the roots, and lay waist a whole village
in their wrath.</p>

<p>The anakondy iz a resident ov the tropikal klimates. He
would freeze up solid in Vermont the fust winter, and would
be kut up into kord wood bi the natives.</p>

<p>Anakondy wood, i should think, if it waz green, would
make a lazy fire.</p>

<h3 id="sec-93-4">THE GARTER SNAIX.</h3>

<p>The garter snaik derives hiz name from the habit he haz
ov slipping up a gentlemen’s leg, and tieing himself into an
artistik bo knot about hiz stocking, just belo the knee.</p>

<p>This iz more ornamental than pleasant, and haz been known
tew result in the deth ov the snaix.</p>

<p>I kan imagine several things more pleasant than a live
snaix festooned around one ov my legs; but then I am a nervous
<span id="pg_196" class="page_anchor">196 </span>
individual, and when enny thing begins tew krawl around
on me promiskus, I am too apt tew inquire into suddenly.</p>

<p>I suppoze thare iz plenty ov stoicks would luv tew hav a
snaix do this, and would pat him on the hed, and chuck him
under the chin, and sich like.</p>

<p>I giv all snaix fair notiss that they kant garter me, and if
I couldn’t git rid of them enny other way, I would dissever
miself from the leg, and stump it the rest ov mi daze.</p>

<p>But the more i reflekt upon theze things, the more i think
the garter snaix iz a mith—a kind of inexplicable thing, indiskribabel,
full ov mistery, and iz a mere type or shaddo ov the
old, time-honored garter itself.</p>

<p>Thare iz a grate deal ov dream-like mist and wonderment
in the garter.</p>

<p>They liv in poetry and song, and are seldum seen.</p>

<h3 id="sec-93-5">THE EEL SNAIK.</h3>

<p>The eel snaix iz the only kind that iz valuable for food.</p>

<p>They will bight a hook az cheerfully az a snapping turtle,
and hang on like a puppy tew an old kowhide boot.</p>

<p>They are much eazier tew git onto a hook than to git oph,
for when yu draw them out ov the water they will tie themselfs
and the fish line into more than 7 hundred dilemmas.</p>

<p>I had just az leafs take a bumbel bee oph from a dandylion
az an eel off from a hook.</p>

<p>Fried eels are sed tew be good, but I alwus hav tew shut at
least one eye when I eat them.</p>

<p>I don’t know az an eel iz the same az a snaix exactly, but
they are near enuff to suit me.</p>

<h3 id="sec-93-6">THE SEE SARPENT SNAIX.</h3>

<p>The see sarpent snaik beats all the snaix that have ever put

<p>Thare ain’t but one ov them, and he haz only been seen 5

<p>The fust time he was seen waz off Nahant, on the Amerikan
shore, and waz seen thare twice afterwards.</p>

<span id="pg_197" class="page_anchor">197 </span>

<p>He haz been seen twice at Newport, and we are told by the
knowing ones, that he certainly may be expekted thare next
season, and all judicious persons are urged tew engage their
rooms at the hotels, in time tew witness the grate moral
show.</p>

<p>This snaix iz believed bi naturalists tew be one thousand
feet in length, with a head on him az big az a two story log-hous.</p>

<p>He mezzures one hundred feet in diameter, and iz 90 feet
from hiz mouth tew the baze ov hiz fust phin.</p>

<p>He haz tew rows ov teeth in his upper and lower jaws,
each tooth being three foot in length, and requires 10 tons ov
fish for hiz daily support.</p>

<p>He coils himself about the largest whale, and crushes him
tew jelly, in about 15 minnitts.</p>

<p>He travels between the coast ov Labrador and the Gulph
ov Mexico, and kan make, aginst a hed wind, one hundred
and thirty-six nots an hour.</p>

<p>The crowned heds ov Europe would giv almost ennything
if he would visit their shores, but he iz the <i>Grate Amerikan
Snaix</i>, and don’t hav tew leave home.</p>

<h3 id="sec-93-7">THE KOPPER-HED SNAIX.</h3>

<p>This pison kuss iz about 18 inches long, ov a dark yello
colour, and az phull ov natral venom az a quart ov modern
whiskey.</p>

<p>They live on the side hills amung the rocks and stones, and
are alwus reddy tew bight at a minnitt’s notiss.</p>

<p>They are the meanest snaix that meanders for a living, and
thare iz pizen enuff in one ov them to kill oph a whole tribe
ov border injuns, if it waz judiciously applied.</p>

<p>I have killed them miself in the month ov August when
they waz so phull ov deadly virus that it would make yu sea-sik
tew look at them.</p>

<p>I kant think ov a meaner deth than tew be bit by a kopper-hed
and then lay down and die; it iz almost az unpleasant az
being hung.</p>

<span id="pg_198" class="page_anchor">198 </span>

<p>Snaix dun a bad job for man in the gardin ov Eden, and
whi they are still allowed tew hang around this world iz one
ov thoze misterys which are a hard job for an unedukated
man like me tew explain.</p>

<p>I abhor a snaix ov enny kind, but when they hav the power
ov pizoning a fellow, added tew their ability tew skare him
into fits, they are sublimely pestiverous.</p>

<h2 id="sec-94">THE BLU JAY AND OTHERS.</h2>

<h3 id="sec-94-1">THE BLUJAY.</h3>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> blujay iz the dandy amung birds, a feathered fop, a
jackanapes by natur, and ov no use only tew steal korn
and eat it on a rail.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill-33">
<a href="images/ill-34.jpg"><img src="images/ill-34_min.jpg" alt=""></a>
<p class="caption">THE BLUJAY.</p>
</div>

<p>They are a misterious
bird, for I hav
seen them solitary
and alone in the
wooded wilderness,
one hundred miles
from enny sighns ov
civilizashun.</p>

<p>Az a means ov
diet, they are just
about az luxurious az
a biled indigo bag
would be, such az the
washwimmin use
tew blue their clothes
with.</p>

<p>The blujay haz no
song—they kant
sing even “From Greenland’s Icy Mountains;” but i must
sa that a flok ov them, flying amung the evergreens on a kold
winter’s morning, are hi colored and eazy tew look at.</p>

<span id="pg_199" class="page_anchor">199 </span>

<p>It iz hard work for me to say a harsh word aginst the birds,
but when i write their history it iz a duty i owe tew posterity
not to lie.</p>

<h3 id="sec-94-2">THE QUAIL.</h3>

<p>The quail iz a game bird, about one size bigger than the
robin, and so sudden that they hum when they fly.</p>

<p>They hav no song, but whissell for musik; the tune iz solitary
and sad.</p>

<p>They are shot on the wing, and a man may be good in
arithmetick, fust rate at parseing, and even be able tew preach
acceptably, but if he hain’t studdied quail on the wing, he
might az well shoot at a streak ov lightning in the sky az at
a quail on the go.</p>

<p>Briled quail, properly supported with jellys, toast, and a
champane Charlie, iz just the most diffikult thing, in mi humble
opinyun, to beat in the whole history ov vittles and sumthing
tew drink.</p>

<p>I am no gourmand, for i kan eat bred and milk five days
out ov seven, and smak mi lips after i git thru, but if i am
asked to eat briled quail by a friend, with judishious accompanyments,
i blush at fust, then bow mi hed, and then smile
sweet acquiescence—in other words, I always quail before
such a request.</p>

<h3 id="sec-94-3">THE PATRIDGE.</h3>

<p>The patridge iz also a game bird. Their game iz tew drum
on a log in the spring ov the year, and keep both eyes open,
watching the sportsmen.</p>

<p>Patridges are shot on the wing, and are az easy to miss az
a ghost iz.</p>

<p>It iz phun enuff to see the old bird hide her yung brood
when danger iz near. This must be seen, it kant be described
and make enny boddy beleave it.</p>

<p>The patridge, grouse, and pheasant are cousins, and either
one ov them straddle a gridiron natural enuff tew hav bin
born thare.</p>

<span id="pg_200" class="page_anchor">200 </span>

<p>Take a couple of yung patridges and pot them down, and
serve up with the right kind ov a chorus, and they beat the
ham sandwich yu buy in the Camden and Amboy Railroad
87 1-2 per cent.</p>

<p>I have eat theze lamentabel Nu Jersey ham sandwich, and
must sa that i prefer a couple ov bass wood chips, soaked in
mustard water, and stuk together with Spalding’s glue.</p>

<h3 id="sec-94-4">THE WOODKOK.</h3>

<p>The woodkok iz one ov them kind ov birds who kan git
up from the ground with about az much whizz, and about az
bizzy az a fire-kracker, and fly away az krooked az a kork-skrew.</p>

<p>They feed on low, wet lands, and only eat the most delikate
things.</p>

<p>They run their tungs down into the soft earth, and gather
tender juices and tiny phood.</p>

<p>They hav a long, slender bill, and a rich brown plumage,
and when they lite on the ground yu lose sight ov them az
quick az yu do ov a drop ov water when it falls into a mill
pond.</p>

<p>The fust thing yu generally see ov a woodkok iz a <i>whizz</i>,
and the last thing a <i>whurr</i>.</p>

<p>How so many ov them are killed on the wing iz a mistery
to me, for it iz a quicker job than snatching pennys oph a
red-hot stove.</p>

<p>I hav shot at them often, but i never heard ov my killing
one ov them yet.</p>

<p>They are one ov the game birds, and menny good judges
think they are the most elegant vittles that wear feathers.</p>

<h3 id="sec-94-5">THE GUINA HEN.</h3>

<p>The guina hen iz a spekled kritter, smaller than the goose,
and bigger than the wild pigeon.</p>

<p>They hav a keen eye, and a red kokade on their heds, and
alwas walk on the run.</p>

<p>They lay eggs in great profushun, but they lay them so
<span id="pg_201" class="page_anchor">201 </span>
much on the sly, that they often kan’t find them themselfs.</p>

<p>They are az freckled az a coach dog, and just about az tuff
tew eat az a half-biled krow.</p>

<p>They hav a voic like a piccallo flute, and for racket two
ov them kan make a saw that iz being filed ashamed ov itself.</p>

<p>They are a very shy bird, and the nearer yu git tew them
the further they git oph.</p>

<p>They are more ornamental than uceful, but are chiefly
good tew frighten away hawks.</p>

<p>They will see a hawk up in the sky three miles and a-half
off, and will begin at once tew holler and make a fuss about it.</p>

<h3 id="sec-94-6">THE GOSLIN.</h3>

<p>The goslin iz the old goose’s yung child. They are yeller
all over, and az soft az a ball ov worsted. Their foot iz
wove whole, and they kan swim az eazy az a drop of kaster
oil on the water.</p>

<p>They are born annually about the 15th ov May, and never
waz known tew die natually.</p>

<p>If a man should tell me he had saw a goose die a natral
and square deth, I wouldn’t believe him under oath after
that, not even if he swore he had lied about seeing a goose
die.</p>

<p>The goose are different in one respekt from the human
family, who are sed tew grow weaker but wizer; whereaz a
goslin alwus grows tuffer and more phoolish.</p>

<p>I hav seen a goose that they sed waz 93 years old last June,
and he didn’t look an hour older than one that waz 17.</p>

<p>The goslin waddles when he walks, and paddles when he
swims, but never dives, like a duk, out ov sight in the water,
but only changes ends.</p>

<p>The food ov the goslin iz rye, corn, oats, and barley, sweet
apples, hasty pudding, and biled kabbage, cooked potatoze,
raw meat, and turnips, stale bred, kold hash, and the buckwheat
kakes that are left over.</p>

<p>They ain’t so partiklar az sum pholks what they eat, and
won’t git mad and quit if they kan’t hav wet toast and lam
chops every morning for breakfast.</p>

<span id="pg_202" class="page_anchor">202 </span>

<p>If i waz a going tew keep boarders, i wouldn’t want enny
better feeders than an old she goose and 12 goslins. If i
kouldn’t suit them i should konklude i had mistaken mi
kalling.</p>

<p>Roast goslin iz good nourishment, if you kan git enuff ov
it, but thare aint much waste meat on a goslin, after yu hav
got rid ov their feathers, and dug them out inside.</p>

<p>I hav alwus notissd, when yu pass yure plate up for sum
more baked goslin, at a hotel, the colored brother cums bak
empty with plate, and tells yu, “Mister, the roast goslin iz
no more.”</p>

<h2 id="sec-95">SMALL-SIZED VERMIN.</h2>

<h3 id="sec-95-1">THE GRUB.</h3>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> grub iz all the fashionabel kullers except checkered,
i never have saw a checkered grub so far.</p>

<p>I would giv ten cents tew see a checkered grub.</p>

<p>The grub (that i am talking about) boards in old rotten
logs, and dekayed stumps, and grubs for a living.</p>

<p>They are about one intch in size, and are bilt like a skrew.</p>

<p>They look for all the world like a short strip ov phatt pork.</p>

<p>They enter rotten wood, like an intch skrew, pursewed bi
a skrew-driver.</p>

<p>They are very mutch retired in their habits, and are az free
from anger az a tudstool.</p>

<p>Sum pholks kant see enny munny in a grub, but i kan.</p>

<p>I hav chopt them out ov an old stump, the further end ov
April, and then put them onto a hook, and krept down behind
a bunch of willows, in the meadow, and dropt them,
kind a natral, into the swift water, and in less than forty
seckonds hav jerked out ov the silvery flood twelve ounces ov
trout, and while he turned purple, and gold summersetts on
the grass, i hav had mi harte swell up in me, like a halleluyer.</p>

<h3 id="sec-95-2">THE LADY BUG.</h3>

<p>The lady bug iz
the most genteel
vermin in market.</p>

<p>They are spotted
red and blak for color,
are about the size ov a double B shot, and don’t look unlike
a drop ov red sealing wax.</p>

<p>They hang around gardens in the spring ov the year, and
are wuss, and quicker, on kukumber vines, than a distrikt
skoolmaster iz on a kittle ov warm pork and beans.</p>

<p>The lady bug iz the pet ov little children, who ketch them
in their hands and then sing to them the old nursery rime:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“Lady bug, lady bug, fly away home,</div>
<div class="line">Your house is on fire, and your children will roam.<ins title="Note: “’” in the original" id="cg_50">”</ins></div>
</div>

<p>Let them go, and sure enough the lady bug duz put for
home in a grate hurry.</p>

<p>The lady bug iz probably useful, but Webster’s unabridged
dont tell us for what.</p>

<p>Whenever i cum akros enny bug, that i dont know what
they waz built for, i dont blame the bug.</p>

<span id="pg_204" class="page_anchor">204 </span>

<p>I hav grate phaith in ennything that kreeps, krawls, or even
wiggles, and tho i haint been able tew satisfy miself all about
the usefulness ov bed bugs, musketoze, and striped snaix, i
hav phaith that Divine Providence did not make them in vain.</p>

<p>Phaith iz knolledge ov the highest order.</p>

<h3 id="sec-95-3">THE TREE-TUD.</h3>

<p>Did you ever see a tree-tud, mi christian friends? If yu
didn’t, cum with me next July, and i will sho yu one.</p>

<p>Morrally konsidered, they are like enny other tud, physikally
they aint.</p>

<p>They are about the size ov an old-fashioned 25 cent piece,
a hed on one side ov them, and a tail on the other.</p>

<p>They are the only tuds that kan klimb with enny degree
of alakrity, and are the only ones that kan sing like a tea-kittle
when she is cooking water.</p>

<p>Tree-tuds, when they are on a tree, or on the top rale ov a
phence, hav the faculty ov disguising their personal looks,
and appearing exactly like the spot where they set.</p>

<p>I have often put mi hand on them in getting over a phence.
They wont bight nor jaw back, but they feal az raw and kold
az the yelk ov an egg.</p>

<p>The tree-tud livs upon flies and sitch like vittles, but if they
dont git enny thing tew eat, they dont strike for higher wages.</p>

<p>A tree-tud will liv all summer on a south wind, with an
ockashional drop ov dew to wet hiz song.</p>

<p>They kan outdiet any bug or jumping thing i kno ov.</p>

<h3 id="sec-95-4">THE PORKUPINE.</h3>

<p>The porkupine iz a kind ov thorny woodchuck.</p>

<p>They are bigger than a rat, and smaller than a calf.</p>

<p>They liv in the ground, and are az prikly all over az a
chesnutt burr, or a case ov the hives.</p>

<p>It iz sed that they hav the power ov throwing their prickers
like a javelin, but this iz a smart falshood.</p>

<p>An old dog wont tutch a porkupine enny quicker than he
<span id="pg_205" class="page_anchor">205 </span>
would a phire brand, but yung dogs pitch into them like urchins
into a sugar hogshed.</p>

<p>The konsequentz ov this iz they git their mouths philled
with prickers, which are bearded, and kant bak out.</p>

<p>A porkupine’s quill when it enters goes klean thru and
cums out on the other side ov things. This iz a way they
hav got.</p>

<p>The porkupine iz not bad vittles, their meat tastes like pork
and beans with the beans left out.</p>

<p>They hav a cute way ov stealing apples known only to a phew.</p>

<p>I hav seen them run under an apple tree, and rolling over
on the fruit which had fallen from the tree, carry oph on their
prickers a dozen ov them.</p>

<p>I hav often told this story to people, but never got enny
tew beleave it yet.</p>

<p>Porkupines hav got a destiny tew phill, it may be only a
hole in the ground, but they kan phill that az phull az it will
hold.</p>

<h3 id="sec-95-5">DEVIL’S DARNING NEEDLE.</h3>

<p>This floating animal iz a fly about twenty times az big az a
hornet, with a pair ov wings on him az mutch out ov proporshun
tew hiz boddy az a pair ov oars are to a shell boat.</p>

<p>They hang around mill ponds in hot weather, and when i
waz a boy if one ov them cum and sot on the further end ov
the log whare i waz a setting i alwus aroze and gave him the
whole of the log.</p>

<p>They hav a boddy like a piece ov wire, sharp at the end, and
look az tho they mite sting a phello cheerfully, but i beleave
there iz no more sting in them than thare iz in kold water.</p>

<p>All children are afrade ov them, and i kno ov one man
now who had rather enkounter a wild kat (provided the kat
waz up in the top ov a tree and likely to stay thare) than tew
intersect a devil’s darning needle.</p>

<p>They derive their name from the shape ov their boddys
and their devilish appearance generally. (See Webster’s

<p>It is a fakt (known to us doktors) that yu kan ketch the little

<p>I think most men had rather be charged with malice than
with making a blunder.</p>

<p>Love cuts up all sorts ov monkey shines, it makes a
fool sober, and a wize man frisky.</p>

<p>I don’t beleave in total depravity, every man haz sumthing

<p>I suppoze that one reazon whi the “road to ruin” iz broad,
iz tew accomadate the grate amount ov travel in that direkshun.</p>

<p>I think i had rather hear a man brag about himself, than
tew hear him brag all the time ov sum one else—for i think i
like vanity a leetle better than i do sickofansy.</p>

<p>A humbug iz like a bladder, good for nothing till it iz
blowed up, and then ain’t good for nothing after it iz pricked.</p>

<p>A bigg noze iz sed tew be a sighn ov genius—if a man’s
genius lays in hiz noze, i should say the sign waz a good one.</p>

<p>Vanity iz seldom malishous.</p>

<p>A woman (like an echo), will hav the last word.</p>

<p>Put an Englishman into the garden of Eden, and he would
find fault with the whole blassted consarn—put a Yankee in,
and he would see whare he could alter it to advantage—put
an Irishman in, and he would want tew boss the thing—put
a Dutchman in, and he would proceed at once to plant it.</p>

<p>When a man is squandering hiz estate, even those who are
getting it, call him a phool.</p>

<p>Men mourn for what they hav lost—wimmin, for what
they hain’t got.</p>

<p>I judge ov a man’s virtew entirely bi his phashions—it iz
a grate deal eazier tew be a good dove, than a decent sarpent.</p>

<p>Thare are menny ways to find out how brave and how
honest a man may be, but thare aint no way to find out the
extent ov hiz vanity.</p>

<p>A lie iz like a cat, it never cums to yu in a straight line.</p>

<p>Natur iz a kind mother. She couldn’t well afford to make
us perfekt, and so she made us blind to our failings.</p>

<p>Studdy the heart if yu want to learn human natur; there
ain’t no human natur in a man’s head.</p>

<p>Friendship iz simply the gallantry of self interest.</p>

<p>I hav spent a large porshun ov mi life in hopeing, and

and i intend tew spend a grate deal more time in the same

<p>Success don’t konsist in never making blunders, but in

<p>He who trusts tew luck for his happiness, will be lucky

<p>Az a genral thing, we envy in others, not what we aint

<p>The only thing about a man that sin haz not, and kan not

<p>Early genius iz like early cabbage, don’t head well.</p>

<p>It iz a grate deal more eazier tew drop down 10 feet on a

<p>Experience iz a grindstun, and it iz lucky for us if we kan
git brightened by it, not ground.</p>

<p>We shouldn’t forgit one thing, that thare iz not a single fee

<p>Ignorance iz the wet nuss of prejudice.</p>

<p>Anticipation iz constantly nibbling expekted pleazure untill

<p>I never knu a man trubbled with melankolly, who had
plenty to dew, and did it.</p>

<p>Good breeding, az i understand it, iz giving every man

<p>Talk little, but listen out loud, yung man, iz the way tew

<p>People when they find fault with theirselfs, are generally
more anxious tew be consoled than forgiven, and, therefore,
when a man begins tew confess hiz sins tew me and sez, “<i>thare

about it, and i guess iz more than half right.</p>

<p>What the world wants iz good examples, not so mutch

<p>What makes a ghost so respektable a karakter iz, that noboddy

<p>The pedigree that we receive from our ansestors iz like the
money we receive from them, we are not expekted tew liv
on the principle, but on the accumulashun, and transmit the
principle unimpaired.</p>

<p>A weak man wants az mutch watching az a bad one.</p>

<p>It iz hard work tew define human happiness, the real possessor

<p>Wealth iz no guard aginst villany, thare iz az mutch iniquity

<p>I am satisfied that courage in men iz more often the effekt

<p>About the best thing that experience kan teach us iz tew

<p>Mans necessitys are phew, but hiz wants are endless.</p>

<p>Thare are menny people who not only beleave that this

<p>Self-made men are most alwus apt tew be a leetle too

<p>I think thare iz az menny old phools in the world, az thare

<p>The ambishun of 9 men out of 10, if it should receive no

<p>A vishus old man iz a terrible sight dispised on earth and

<p>Bashfulness iz either the effek ov ignorance or modesty—if
it iz ignorance, edukashun changes it into impertinence—if
it iz modesty, it will kling tew a man a long az he haz got
one single virtew left.</p>

<p>Marrying for buty iz a poor spekulashun, for enny man

<p><i>Hope</i> iz the germ, <i>Faith</i> the blossom, and <i>Charity</i> the

<p>Thare iz this difference between a weak friend and a bitter

<p>Whenever yu kan find a man to whom yu kan tell all yure
sekrets, and still retain hiz respekt, yu have found a friend
indeed.</p>

<p>When a man abuzes me i will pay no more attenshon tew

<p>Thare iz this mutch kan be sed in favour ov good-breeding,
it iz the only thing that kan make a phool endurable.</p>

<p>Thare ain’t mutch phun in phisick, but thare iz a good

<p>Men will forgit injurys eazier than kontempt; they had
rather be hated than not noticed.</p>

<p>I hav bin watching human intercourse a little lately, and i
find it is largely made up ov <i>grunts</i>, <i>groans</i> and <i>growls</i>, varied
with <i>huffs</i>, <i>hoots</i>, and howls.</p>

<p>I like a good hater, but i want him able tew giv good reazons
for it.</p>

<p>About the emptyest thing i kno ov iz a pocket-book, with
nothing in it—it iz rather wuss than a knot-hole.</p>

<p>The man who pitys everyboddy, wants watching, for the
chances are that he iz gitting phatt slily on other peoples

<p>It seems tew me that good breeding iz the art ov making

<p>Yung man, larn tew listen!—i don’t mean at a key-hole.
Thare iz plenty
ov happiness in this
life if we only knu
it: and one way tew
find it iz, when we
hav got the old rumatiz
tew thank
Heaven that it aint
the old gout.</p>

<p>Men are blamed
for sticking their
noze into things;
but it iz the only
way a dog tracks out
hiz game.</p>

<p>The man who kan
live in idleness
successfully, must
either be too pure or
too lazy to commit
enny sin. Poetri iz a disseaze common tew all the literati:
sum hav it quite hard, but most hav it dredful lite.</p>

<p>Inkredulity iz the wisdum ov a phool; it iz only a wize man
who kan afford tew be credulous.</p>

<p>Prejudice iz a hous plant which is very apt tew wither if
yu take it out doors amungst pholks.</p>

<p>The devil holds poor kards, but he plays them mighty
well.</p>

<p>What iz the next wust thing tew lieing? Gitting ketched
at it.</p>

<span id="pg_235" class="page_anchor">235 </span>

<p>I am so phully aware ov the uncertainty ov the law, that if
a man whom i had never seen nor heard ov should su me for
a <i>debt</i> ov one hundred dollars, and i couldn’t kompound with
him for fifty, i would pay the whole rather than defend the
suit.</p>

<p>I hav noticed this diffrence between people—thare is <i>some</i>
who are not az big phools as they look.</p>

<p>Most authors in writing neglekt their punktuashuns, <ins title="Note: “espeshliy” in the original" id="cg_55">espeshily</ins>
the <i>full stop</i>.</p>

<p>I hav seen pholks so melankolly and so gloomy that they
wouldn’t admit thare waz a brite side tew ennything in this
world, not even tew a nu haff dollar.</p>

<p>If wit forms the blade, good sense should be the handle
and benevolence the skabbard ov the sword.</p>

<p>Experience iz knowledge, and it will stik bi a phellow like
the money he gits by hard knoxs.</p>

<p>I never hav seen a bigot yet but what had a small and apparently
braneless hed—but i hain’t seen all the bigots, yu know.</p>

<p>Silence iz like darkness, a good place tew hide.</p>

<p>Thare iz no revenge so komplete az forgivness.</p>

<p>He that desires tew be ritch only to be charitable, iz not
only a wize man, but a good one.</p>

<p>Grate welth, in our journey thru life, iz only extra baggage,
and wants a heap ov watching.</p>

<p>The malice ov the world ain’t haff so dangerous az its flatterys.</p>

<p>If i feel that i am right, all the kurs in the country may
snap at mi heels.</p>

<p>Trieing tew satisfy our desires with wealth iz like trieing
tew stop up a rat hole with sand—the rats will soon dig out
sum whare else.</p>

<p>A piece ov satire, tew be beneficial, should be so rendered
that every man who reads, or hears it, shall say to himself,
“That iz just, bekauze it hits every boddy but me.”</p>

<p>Skandle iz az ketching az the small pox, and perhaps thare
iz but one real preventative, and that iz—tew be vacksinated
with deaf and dumbness.</p>

<span id="pg_236" class="page_anchor">236 </span>

<p>Really wize men pay but little attenshun to misterys, but
one good mistery will furnish a dozen phools with vittles and
drink for a year, and fat the whole ov them besides.</p>

<p>We are all ov us too apt tew judge ov a sin by its size.
We will pass a 10 cent counterfit shin plaster, when we
would shudder at a 10 dollar bill.</p>

<p>Mi friend haz got hiz phailings, and that iz one thing that
makes me like him so mutch.</p>

<p>Affeckshun iz a vine full ov tendrils, and if yu don’t phurnish
it sumthing better tew climb, it will phurnish itself sumthing
wuss; this ackounts for its running after sore eyed lap
dogs and sick monkeys.</p>

<p>Poverty iz the step mother ov genius.</p>

<p>Beware ov the man who makes a still noize when he walks,
and who purrs when he talks; he iz a kat in disguise.</p>

<p>It iz now 30 years ago since a phellow with green goggles
on and a white neck tie, offered tew sell me sumthing for 50
cents, whitch he sed waz worth 5 dollars. I’ve forgot what it
waz, but i remember it waz a beat, and az often az once a
year ever since, I have tried the same thing over, and got
beat every time.</p>

<p>When shame leaves a man, the kandle goes out, and hiz
soul gropes its way in the dark, a slave tew mean, and brutal
pashuns.</p>

<p>Civilizashun haz made justiss one ov the luxurys, for which
we have tew pay the highest price.</p>

<p>Lies are like a bad penny, sure tew return to their owner.</p>

<p>“<i>Time iz money</i>,”—menny people take this saying in its
literal sense, and undertake tew pay their debts with it.</p>

<p>Competishun iz a good thing, even amung brutes—two
dogs on a farm make both dogs more watchful.</p>

<p>Originality in writing haz alwus been praized, but i hav red
sum authors who were too original tew be interesting.</p>

<p>Altho the learned and witty often cater to the ritch, thare
never waz one yet, however poor, who would swap estates
with them.</p>

<p>If a man iz very bizzy he kant be very sorrowful, nor very
viscious.</p>

<span id="pg_237" class="page_anchor">237 </span>

<p>If thare iz enny human being that i thoroughly loath, it iz

<p>One ov the saddest sights ov all to me, iz an old man, poor
and deserted, whom i once knew living in ease and luxury.</p>

<p>I don’t think the world haz ever seen a sparkling, brilliant
wit yet, who waz not troubled at times with the—<i>hiccups</i>.</p>

<p>Silence iz one ov the hardest kind ov arguments tew refute.</p>

<p>The fust thing in this life tew be desired, in the phisikal
line, iz a happy set ov bowells, after that, virtew, and branes,
are in order.</p>

<p>Justiss now daze aint worth what it kosts.</p>

<p>I’ve seen men so fun-proof that yu kouldn’t fire a joke into
them with a dubble-barreled gun.</p>

<p>Thare are people who are so mutch matter-of-fakt in everything,
that when they eat pork and beans, they want the pork
one day and the beans the next.</p>

<p>If i waz called upon tew tell who waz the bravest man that
ever lived, i would say it waz him <i>who never told a lie</i>.</p>

<p>The meanest thing that enny man ever followed for a bizzness,
iz making money.</p>

<p>Everyboddy luvs tew feel that they are ov sum importanse

<p>The safest way for most folks to do iz to do az the rest do.
Thare aint but phew

<p>A wize man iz
never konfounded bi

generally iz.</p>

<p>Yung man, don’t
grind yure scythe all
on one side!</p>

<p>I don’t know ov a
more lamentable
sight than an old
rake—even repentance
looks like a
weakness in him.</p>

<p>Politeness iz often
wasted, but it iz a
good and a cheap mistake tew make. Our very best thoughts
often cum tew us sudden, but seldum perfekt. They require
polishing up tew make them komplete.</p>

<p>Do a good turn, yung man, whenever yu kan, even if yu
hav tew <i>turn</i> a grindstun to do it.</p>

<p>Repentance iz generally konsidered a weakness, but i kno
ov nothing more indikative ov strength.</p>

<p>Human knowledge iz not very komprehensiv after all, for
i hav seen men who could kalkulate an eklips to a dot, who
couldn’t harness a hoss tew save their lives.</p>

<p>I don’t kno ov a more diffikult karacter tew fill, nor a more
butiful one when filled, than the command in the Bible—“Be

<p>Every boddy in this world wants watching, but none more

<p>Cunning iz very apt tew outwit itself. The man who turned
the boat over and got under it tew keep out ov the rain,
waz one ov this kind.</p>

<p>A weak constitushun kan be strengthened, but a weak set
ov branes kan’t.</p>

<p>Vanity iz a strange pashun—rather than be out ov a job it
will brag ov its vices.</p>

<p>All phools are poor listeners.</p>

<p>About all it takes tew make a wize man iz tew giv other
people’s opinyuns az mutch weight as we do our own.</p>

<p>Flattery iz like ice-kream—to relish good we want it a little
at a time, and often.</p>

<p>The more yu praze a man who don’t deserve it, the more
yu abuze him.</p>

<p>Yu kan’t flatter a truly wize man—he knows just how mutch
praze iz due him; that he takes, and charges over all the ballance
tew the proffit and loss ackount.</p>

<p>Once in a grate while Fortune will acktualy hunt for a man,

<p>Thare seems tew be a degree of excentricity attending all,

<p>I don’t beleave in fatalism, only so far az phools and raskals

<p>It iz very diffikult for me tew tell whi the lion should be

<p>How kan we ever expekt tew find a perfekt person in this

<p>Sosiety iz made up ov the good, bad, and indifferent; and
what makes so mutch trouble iz, the <i>indifferents</i> are in the

<p>A man who iz neither good nor bad iz like an old musket
laid away, without any lock, but a heavy charge in it.</p>

<p>When a man haz dun a charitable thing without letting the
world kno it, he haz dun all that an angel kould do in the

<p>Too mutch ov the religion in this world konsists in konfessing
our sins to ourselfs and to each other.</p>

<p>I don’t suppoze thare haz ever lived a man without a single

<p>The old saying haz it, “it iz a wize child that knows hiz

<p>The vanity ov most men iz so mutch more than a match

<p>The pashuns are like the wick ov a lighted kandle—they

<p>Thare iz lots ov folks who are in sich a grate hurry tew git

<p>A man with a hed phull ov branes kan afford tew be

<p>I will say this for man—i don’t kno ov enny enterprize he
haz ever undertaken yet which had for its desighn the general
interest ov humanity, but what haz succeeded.</p>

<p>If i am charitable, if i am komplasent, if i am grateful, if
i am honest, if i am virtewous—what ov it?—i hav simply

<p>I am satisfied that thare aint no sich thing az <i>eloquent

<p>Style iz everything for a sinner, and a leetle ov it won’t

<p>Gravity, az a general thing, iz either the wizdum ov a phool
or the cunning ov a raskall.</p>

<p>Humility iz a good thing tew hav, provided a man iz sure

<p>Thare iz one pashun (and it iz the meanest one) that no man
who haz ever lived, haz been free from, and that iz envy.</p>

<p>Indolence iz one ov the strongest pashuns, becauze it iz one

<p>Most ov the excentricitys we meet with amung men iz mere

<p>Pashunce iz a good thing for a man tew hav, provided he

<p>The only safe way for most people tew git along in this

<p>Human happiness iz like Joseph’s coat—a thing of menny

<p>I kant tell which iz the wuss off, the man who iz all hed and
no heart, or the one who iz all heart and no hed.</p>

<p>Hope iz no flatterer—she cheats every body alike, but after

<p>Every boddy seems tew dispize a hippokrit—God, man, and

<p>An idle man iz always a bizzy one—he spends all hiz time

<p>The very thing that most men think they have got the
most ov, they hav got the least ov, and that iz judgement.</p>

<p>A man iz vain just in proportion tew hiz pholly, and wize,
just in proportion tew hiz humility.</p>

<p>A vain man, flushed with success, spreads himself like a
peakock, in a fair day, but when hiz hour ov trial cums, like
a peakock, in a wet day, he folds hiz spread, “and steals
silently away.”</p>

<p>When vice leaves an old man, it iz no ways certain that
virtew takes the place ov it, for sin sumtimes quits us bekause

<p>People who havn’t got ennything tew say, kan always find

<p>Most folks think, if they were tew liv their lives over agin,
they would do <i>different</i>, but i hav never heard enny ov them

<p>It seems very natral for all ov us to think that the world

want but one man left on the face ov the earth, he would
think just so too.</p>

<p>The luxurys ov life, which are so often reprimandid, are

<p>Munny ain’t akumulated so mutch tew satisfy wants, as

<p>It iz a very wize man who is able tew hide his ignorance.</p>

<p>Wisdum iz another name for genius, and both are the gift

<p>A man kant learn tew be wize, enny more than he kan

<p>One man, of good 40 hoss power common sens, iz worth

<p>Fools and drunken men alwus make this mistake, the one

<p>He whom prosperity humbles, and adversity strengthens,

<p>Faith beats both wisdum and learning.</p>

<p>Envy and jealousy are two pashunz, which no man haz
ever yet been free from, and yet no man ever admits he iz
possessed of them.</p>

<p>Take all the good luk out ov this world, and millionaires

<p>Genius, like the yung eagle, don’t hav tew make enny trial

<p>One way tew define love iz, that it makes us pheal phunny

<p>Love feeds on hopes and fears, and, like the chameleon,
takes its color from what it feeds on.</p>

<p>Silence makes but phew blunders, and thoze it kan easily
korrekt.</p>

<p>Thare iz hardly enny man so wicked but that he respekts
virtew for the protekshun it affords him.</p>

<p>The further advances a man makes in knowledge, the less
satisfied he iz with what he knows.</p>

<p>Gallantry may possibly be defined az the politeness ov
flattery.</p>

<p>My yung friend, don’t forgit one thing—however cunning
yu may be, the eazyest man in all the world for yu tew cheat

<p>Az good a way az i kno ov tew git at enny man’s honesty,
iz tew divide what he claims tew hav by four, and then guess
at what’s left.</p>

<p>The text which haz been most preached from by the human

<p>Thare are az menny old phools in this world az yung ones,

<p>I like a wide-awake christian, one whoze virtew has got
some kayenne pepper in it.</p>

<p>Indolence may not be a crime, but it iz liable tew be at enny
time.</p>

<p>I am satisfied thare is more imaginary trouble in this world
than real.</p>

<p>Most ov us, when we repent ov our sins, think it iz a change
ov heart, when in fakt, it iz only a fear ov punishment.</p>

<p>I hav sumtimes thought that the man with menny vices,
<span id="pg_268" class="page_anchor">268 </span>
was safer than with one, for the menny vices often wear each
other out, while the one wears the man out.</p>

<p>Thare iz a time for all things, thare is a time tew pray, and
thare iz a time to say <i>amen</i>, rool up yure sleeves and pitch in.</p>

<p>“<i>Reform! Reform!</i>” this iz too often the watchword ov
mere charlatans.</p>

<p>Thare iz but very phew men whoze wisdum lasts them their

<p>Thare iz hipokrits in vice az well az in virtew; i have seen

<p>It iz hard work for us tew luv a man who haz no faults nor

<p>He who sues for suckcess don’t git it so often az he who

<p>Suckcess iz a coquet, and a bashful lover never wins her.</p>

<p>No woman yet waz ever satisfied to be a prude, who could
be a suckcessfull coquet.</p>

<p>Flattery iz just like cheeze, or ennything else we deal in,
the supply is alwus regulated bi the demand.</p>

<p>If all the vanity should leave this world, haff the virtew

<p>Blood ain’t nothing, munny and clothes iz what tells.</p>

<p>The things in this world that are the best done show the

the reason ov this iz, bekauze they are so natral.</p>

<p>It iz eazy enuff, perhaps, for us tew tell what we admire,

so eazy.</p>

<p>Amung the vast number ov phools in this world thare iz

<p>It iz awl important that fashion should be perfumed with

<p>He whom the good praize and wicked hate ought tew be

<p>The best investment I kno ov, iz charity, yu git yure principle

<p>Politeness looks well to me in every man, except an

<p>We are happy in this world just in proporshun as we make

<p>I dont think thare ever waz a human being yet, who haz

<p>I am glad ov one thing, that i am keenly alive tew mental

<p>Thare are but phew men weak enuff tew admit their jealousys—even

<p>Thare haz been more men in this world burnt at the stake

<p>I alwus did admire the malice ov the mule—if a freak ov

<p>Men no doubt owe mutch ov their suckcess in this world

<p>Prudery iz one ov virtews bastards.</p>

<p>When yu haint got nothing tew do, do it at once; this iz
the way to learn to be bizzy.</p>

<p>We hav bin told that the best way to overkum misfortunes
iz tew fight with them—I hav tried both ways, and recommend
a successful dodge.</p>

<p>The art ov becomeing ov importance in the eyes ov others,
iz not tew overrate ourself, but tew cauze them tew do it.</p>

<p>The true way to understand the judgments ov heaven is to
submit to them.</p>

<p>Method iz everything, espeshily tew ordinary men; the few
men who kan lift a ton, at plessure, hav a divine right tew
take holt ov it tew a disadvantage.</p>

<p>The mind ov man iz like a piece ov land that, tew be useful,
must be manured with learning, ploughed with energy,

<p>Living on Hope, iz like living on wind, a good way tew git

<p>Jealousy don’t pay, the best it kan do, iz tew diskover what

<p>I don’t think a bad man iz az dandgerous az a weak one—I
don’t think that a bile that haz cum tew a hed, iz az risky as a

<p>Hope iz a draft on futurity, sumtimes honored, but generally

<p>If the world dispizes a hypokrit, what must they think ov

<p>Flattery iz like Colone water, tew be smelt ov, not swallowed.</p>

<p>After all, there don’t seem tew be but this diffrence between

<p>Men generally, when they whip a mule, sware; the mule

<p>Sum folks wonder whare awl the lies cum from, but i don’t,

<p>Hunting after fame iz like hunting after fleas, hard tew

<p>Menny people spend their time trieing tew find the hole
whare sin got into this world—if two men brake through the
ice into a mill pond, they had better hunt for sum good hole
tew git out, rather than git into a long argument about the
hole they cum tew fall in.</p>

<p>Imaginashun, tew mutch indulged in, soon iz tortured into

that chance.</p>

<p>Mi private opinyun
about “abscence
ov mind” is, that 9
times out ov 10, it
iz abscence ov branes.</p>

<p>The flattery that
men offer tew themselfs
iz the most
dangerous, bekause
the least suspekted.</p>

<p>Take a kitten that
kan hardly walk on
land, and chuck him
into a mill pond,
and he will swim
ashore—enny boddy
kan apply the moral
in this. The best
philosophers and moralists i hav ever met, hav been thoze
who had plenty to eat, and drink, and had money at interest.</p>

<p>It takes a wize man to suffer prosperity, but most enny
phool kan suffer adversity.</p>

<p>Pride, after all, iz one ov our best friends—it makes us beleave
we are better and happier than our nabors.</p>

<p>Before yu give enny man advise, find out what kind ov advice
will suit him the best.</p>

<p>Knowledge is like money, the more a man gits the more he
hankers for.</p>

<p>The vices and phollys ov grate men are never admired nor
imitated bi grate men.</p>

<span id="pg_290" class="page_anchor">290 </span>

<p>The trew art ov kriticism is tew excuse faults rather than
ridikule them.</p>

<p>We hav no more right to laff at a deformed person, than
we hav at a crooked tree—both ov them are God’s arkitekture.</p>

<p>How strange it iz that most men had rather be flattered for
possessing what they hav not, than to be justly praised for
having what they possess.</p>

<p>Suavity ov manners towards men iz like suavity ov molassis
toward flies, it not only calls them to you, but sticks them
fast after they git thare.</p>

<p>Thare iz a grate deal ov charity in this world so koldly
rendered that it fairly hurts, it iz like lifting a drowning man
out ov the water bi the hair ov the hed, and then letting him
drop on the ground.</p>

<p>Exchanging kompliments iz another name for exchanging
lies.</p>

<p>The greatest thief this world haz ever produced iz <i>Procrastination</i>,
and he is still at large.</p>

<p>Religion iz nothing more than a chattel mortgage, excepted,
and rekorded, az sekurity for a man’s morality, and virtew.</p>

<p>White lies are sed tew be innocent, but i am satisfied that
enny man who will lie for phun, after a while will lie for
wages.</p>

<p>The most valuable thing in this world iz Time, and yet people
waste it as they do water, most of them letting it run full

<p>The devil himself, with all hiz genius, allways travels under

<p>If a dog falls in love with you at first sight, it will do to
trust him—not so with a man.</p>

<p>One ov the hardest things to do is to be a good listener,
thoze who are stone deaf succeed the best.</p>

<p>If you don’t kno how to lie, cheat and steal, turn yure

<p>Things that we kant do wouldn’t be ov enny use to us, if

<p>Amongst animals the most ignorant are the most stubborn,
and i wonder if this ain’t so amungst men.</p>

<p>A phool seems tew be a person who haz more will than
judgment, and more vanity than either.</p>

<p>The fust intimashun i had that i waz gitting old waz, i
found myself telling to mi friends the same storys over again.</p>

<p>In repenting ov sins, men are apt tew repent ov thoze they
haint got, and overlook thoze they hav.</p>

<p>A dandy never yet fell in love—only with himself.</p>

<p>Revenge sumtimes sleeps, but vanity always keeps one eye

<p>Thoze folks who expekt to fail in an enterprise, most generally

<p>Prosperity makes us suspicious ov each other, while adversity

setting a rat-trap, and baiting it with yure own finger.</p>

<p>It is highly important, when a man makes up his minde
tew bekum a raskall, that he shud examine hisself clusly, and
see if he aint better konstructed for a phool.</p>

<p>I argy in this way, if a man is right he cant be too radikal,
if he is rong he kant be too conservatiff.</p>

<p>I beleave in the universal salvashun ov men, but I want
tew pick the men.</p>

<span id="pg_310" class="page_anchor">310 </span>

<p>I beleave in suggar coated pills.—I also beleave that virtue
and wisdum kan be smuggled into a man’s soul bi a good natured
proverb, better and deeper than tew be mortised into it
with a worm-wood mallet and chissell.</p>

<p>The pure don’t grow old enny more than a mountain
spring dus.</p>

<p>Rize arly, work hard, and late, live on what yu kant sell,
giv nothing awa, and if yu dont die ritch, and go tu the
devil, yu ma sue me for damages.</p>

<p>Marrin for love ma be a little risky, but it is so honest, that
God kant help but smile on it.</p>

<p>I think i had rather hav a noze 7 inches and a half long,
(in the clear) than tew be the hansumest man in our county;
for in the fust case, i should work hard tew shorten mi nose
bi some other good qualitys, while in the other case, i probably
should never be told by my looking-glass that i was a
phool.</p>

<p>Awl human happiness is conservatiff; 2 thirds ov the pleasure
in sliding down hill consists in drawing the sled back.
I don’t serpoze thare would be enny fun in sliding down a
hill 34 miles long.</p>

<p>Aul ov us komplain ov the shortness ov life yet we all
waste more time than we uze.</p>

<p>That, some peoples are fond ov bragging about their ansesstors,
and their grate descent, when in fack, their <i>grate
descent</i> iz jist what’s the matter ov them.</p>

<p>We are told “that an honest man is the noblest <i>work</i> ov
God”—but the demand for the <i>work</i> has been so limited,
that i hav thought a large share ov the fust edishun must
still be in the author’s hands.</p>

<p>I never bet enny stamps on the man who iz always telling
what he would have did if he had bin <i>thare</i>; I hav notised
that this kind never git <i>thare</i>.</p>

<span id="pg_311" class="page_anchor">311 </span>

<p>Success in life iz verry apt tew make us forget the time
when we wasn’t much. It iz jist so with the frog on the
jump; he kant remember when he waz a tadpole—but other
folks kan.</p>

<p>I always advise short sermons, espeshily on a hot Sunday.
If a minister cant strike ile in boring 40 minutes, he has
either got a poor gimblet, or else he is boring in the rong
plase.</p>

<p>Thare is 2 kinds of politeness, the ripe, and the too mutch
ripe politeness; a goose has a grate deal of this last kind ov
politeness; i have seen them lower their heds while going
into a barn door, that was 18 foot high.</p>

<p>God save the phools! and don’t let them run out, for if it
want for them, wise men couldn’t get a livin.</p>

<p>Pudding and milk is a good thing tew git happy on, but
too mutch pudding and milk, even, will worry a man.</p>

<p>The man who kan ware a paper collar a hole week and
keap, it klean, aint fit for enny thing else.</p>

bottom.</p>

<p>As spunky people az i hav ever known have been az arrant
kowards.</p>

<p>I had mutch rather <i>alwuss</i> look forward tew the time,
when i am going tew ride in a carriage, than tew look bak
<i>once</i> tew the time when i used to do it.</p>

<p>A certain amount of cerimony seems tew be necessary to
run the soshul masheen with, but when pholks git so mutch
cerimony on hand, that they have tew be formaly introduced
<span id="pg_312" class="page_anchor">312 </span>
every time they meet at an evening meeting, i think that they
hav wore the flesh all oph from cerimony.</p>

<p>When i cum akrost people who are perfektly krazy for ventilashun,
i say to
miself, “that kritter
was brought up
in a windmill.”</p>

<p>The majority ov
the world are like
rats, they live upon
plunder and forsake
a sinking ship.</p>

<p>Punktuality is one
grate element ov
sukcess.</p>

<p>A watch that dont
keep korrekt time is
wuss than no watch
at all.</p>

<p>Grate powers are
useful only az they
are made serviceable—the
value ov a hoss depends upon hiz being well broke.</p>

<p>Too mutch branes iz rather a hindrance than a help to a
simply bizzness man.</p>

<p>A praktikal joke iz like a fall on the ice, thare may be phun
in it, but the one that falls kant alwus see it.</p>

<p>The soundest wisdum cums from experience, but thare iz
a nearer road to it allmost az sure—reading and reflekshun.</p>

<p>He who reads and don’t reflekt, iz like the one who eats
and don’t exercise.</p>

<p>The best reformers the world haz ever seen are thoze who
commense on themselfs.</p>

<p>He who simply repents ov a sin pays only 50 cents on a
dollar, while he who forsakes it pays one hundred.</p>

<p>The more a person hunts for the mote in hiz brother’s eye
the plainer he will diskover—if he iz a man ov sense—the
beam in his own.</p>

<span id="pg_313" class="page_anchor">313 </span>

<p>People are more apt tew make a shield ov their religion
than they are a pruning-hook.</p>

<p>Religion iz too often kut az the clothes are, ackording tew
the prevailing fashun.</p>

<p>It iz eazier tew be virtewous than it iz tew appear so, and
it pays better.</p>

<p>Wicked men should pay homage tew virtew, for though
they do not honor her she iz their gratest safeguard.</p>

<p>The man who haint got enny religion tew defend won’t
defend ennything.</p>

<p>Whi iz it that we despize the man who puts himself in our
power, and are quite az apt to respekt him just in proporshun
az he iz out of our reach.</p>

<p>Modesty iz strength, but diffidence iz weakness. Modesty
iz always an evidence ov worth, while diffidence may be a
consciousness ov evil.</p>

<p>Thare iz but very phew real suckcesses in this world that
are undeserved.</p>

<p>Let no man flatter himself that he kant be spared. Thare
iz more people waiting tew step into hiz shuze than he iz
aware ov.</p>

<p>The longer i liv the more i am convinced that mankind gro
<i>different</i> not <i>worse</i>. Us old pholks are apt to konfound the
terms.</p>

<p>A wicked man iz no kompany for himselfs.</p>

<p>All people luv authority, but the vulgar luv it the most.</p>

<p>It iz eazy enuff tew get at enny man’s wealth, for he that
alwus wants more iz poor, and he that would be satisfied with
less iz ritch.</p>

<p>We pitty others bekauz we are better oph ourselves; the
unfortunate dont pitty the unfortunate.</p>

<p>Pride and poverty hav travelled together now for about 5
thousand years, and pretend to luv each other, but they kant
phool ennyboddy but themselfs.</p>

<p>Lazy men are alwuss the most posative. They are too
lazy to inform themselfs, and too lazy to change their minds.</p>

<p>A man will defend his weak spots a grate deal more sharply
than he will hiz strong ones.</p>

<span id="pg_314" class="page_anchor">314 </span>

<p>If men were stubborn just in proporshun az they waz right,
stubborness would take her seat among the virtews, but men
are generally stubborn just in proporshun az they are ignorant
and wrong.</p>

<p>Genius after all ain’t ennything more than elegant kommon
sense.</p>

<p>Thare iz a grate deal ov dignity in this world, that iz komposed
entirely ov <i>dignity</i>, and nothing else.</p>

<p>We hav professors who teach the art ov talking korrektly,
whi kant we hav sum who will teach the art ov listening
pashuntly.</p>

<p>A skeptik iz one who knows too mutch to be a good phool,
and too little to be wise.</p>

<p>Slander travels on the wind, and whare it cums from, and
whare it will go we don’t enny ov us seem tew kno.</p>

<p>Look out for thoze pholks who are familiar on short notiss,
they are like hornets, they mean <i>sting</i>.</p>

<p>When a man ov <i>larning</i> talks he makes us wonder, but a
wize man makes us think.</p>

<p>It iz safe to say that thoze who go into solitude are not fit
for sosiety, and thoze who are not fit for sosiety are certainly
unfit for solitude.</p>

<p>A sophist iz one who puts hiz light under a half-bushel for
the sake ov letting the light shine thru the kracks.</p>

<p>Style in writing iz like style in dress—a good fit.</p>

<p>How menny suspishus people one meets in this world. If
their nozes waz stuffed with kotton wool they would smell
sum kind ov a rat.</p>

<p>Most ov the animiles and insex (az well az the men) liv on
each other, but the spider iz the meanest in the whole lot, for
they set traps for their viktims, and dont even bait the traps.</p>

<p>What should we do if it want for the churches? Thare iz
a plenty ov people who kant worship God only in a church.
If they were out in a field on the Sabbath day they would at
once bekum lawless, and fall to digging out woodchucks or
hunting for bumblebees’ nests.</p>

<p>People worth noticing should never forgit that everything
<span id="pg_315" class="page_anchor">315 </span>
they say and do iz watched by sumboddy, and it iz equally
true that the good things are generally forgot, but the bad
ones never.</p>

<p>I phully apreshiate the proverb, “that speech iz silver, but
silence iz golden,” but i must say that sum ov the most diskreet
and dignified phools that i hav ever met hav been thoze
who never ventured an opinyun on enny subjekt.</p>

<p>What iz happier tew meet than a good temper? It iz like
the sun bi day and the soft harvest moon bi nite.</p>

<p>Giv every one you meet, my boy, the time ov day and haff
the road, and if that dont make him civil dont waste enny
more fragrance on the cuss.</p>

<p>Sum pholks are natrally so kross and krabbid that it iz an
insult tew them to ask them tew be polite. Yu mite as well
ask a dog tew take the krook out ov hiz tale, and be a gentleman.</p>

<p>Thare iz a grate deal ov religion in this world that iz like
a life-preserver—only put on at the moment ov extreme danger,
and put on then, haff the time, hind side before.</p>

<p>With all the howling for liberty that men and wimmin
engage in, thare iz, after all, but very little ov it in the world—we
are all ov us slaves to sumthing.</p>

<p>I hav often heard ov men who had bekum disgusted with
the world, and retired into solitude; but i hav never heard
ov a kommitty ov our fust citizens waiting on them and asking
them tew kum bak.</p>

<p>Pedigree may be valuabel for a man, but i notiss it ain’t
wuth mutch for a hoss: for the fust question that iz asked, iz:
“What can he go out and show?”</p>

<p>I never hav known a man yet die at three skore years and
ten possessed ov the welth that he had got rongfully.</p>

<p>Peace iz the shaddo that the setting sun ov a virtewous
life kasts.</p>

<p>Side by side ov Plain Truth stands Common Sense—two
ov the gratest warriors time haz ever produced.</p>

<p>Diogoneze waz a grater man than Alexander, not bekauze
he lived in a tub, but bekauze a tub waz all he wanted tew
<span id="pg_316" class="page_anchor">316 </span>
liv in; wealth could not flatter him, nor could poverty make
him afrade.</p>

<p>It takes just 3 times az long tew tell a lie, on enny subjekt,
az it duz tew tell the truth.</p>

<p>Vanity iz the most jealous disseaze; i hav saw men so vain
that they kouldn’t look with kompozure upon a peakok
spreading hiz appendix tew the morning sun.</p>

<p>Tru valor iz like honesty, it enters into all that a man sez
or duz.</p>

<p>The man who thinks “he kant do it,” iz alwuss more than
haff right.</p>

<p>One ov the hardest things tew learn a child, iz tew tell the
truth, but it should be done, if—death ensues.</p>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">M</span>ost</span> people are like an egg, too phull ov themselfs to

<p>Thare iz this difference between genius and tallent, one iz

up.</p>

<p>“Misery luvs kompany,” but kant bear kompetishun, thare

ov a bull dog to lie in hiz own gateway.</p>

<p>Mi friend, yu may be more cunning than <i>most</i> men, but yu
aint more cunning
than <i>all</i> men.</p>

<p>Excentricitys are
most alwus artyfishall,
and the best that
kan be sed ov them
iz, they are quite
az often the result
ov diffidence az ov
vanity.</p>

<p>If i want tew git
at the trew karakter
ov a man, i studdy
hiz vices more than
i do hiz virtews.</p>

<p>Faith wont make
a man virtewous,
but it makes what
virtew he haz got
red hot. Those
who expekt tew keep themselfs pure in this life, must keep
their souls bileing all the time, like a pot, and keep all the
time skimming the surface.</p>

<p>It don’t do tew trust a man too mutch, who iz alwus in a
hurry, he iz like a pissmire, whose heart and bones lays in
hiz heels.</p>

<p>Thare iz nothing so delishus tew the soul ov man az an ockashional
moment ov sadness.</p>

<p>The man whose only plezzure in this life, iz making munny,
weighs less on the moral skales than an angleworm.</p>

<span id="pg_318" class="page_anchor">318 </span>

<p><i>Manner</i> iz far more attraktive than <i>matter</i>—monkeys are
watched clusser than eagles are.</p>

<p>Jelous people alwus luv themselfs more than they do thoze
whom they are jelous ov.</p>

<p>Curiosity iz the germ ov all enterprizes—men dig for woodchucks
more for curiosity, than they do for woodchucks.</p>

<p>The purest and best specimens ov human natur that the
world haz <ins title="Note: “even” in the original" id="cg_63">ever</ins> seen, or ever will see, hav bin the virtewous
heathen.</p>

<p>Men don’t fall so often in this world from a want ov right
motives, az they do from lack ov grip.</p>

<p>Thare iz only two men in this world who never make enny
blunders, and they are <i>yu</i> and <i>me</i>, mi friend.</p>

<p>Every man seemz tew hav hiz price, except the newsmonger,
they prefer to work for nothing, and board themselfs.</p>

<p>Yung man, yu kant learn ennything bi hearing yureself
talk, but yu may possibly by hearing others.</p>

<p>Thare iz no one who kan disregard with impunity the proprietys
ov life, but thare are menny people who, if they aint
propper, ain’t nothing.</p>

<p>Thare iz lots ov folks in this world whom yu kan blo up
like a bladder, and then kik them az high az yu pleze.</p>

<p>I hav alwus notissed one thing, that when a cunning man
burns hiz fingers every boddy hollers for joy.</p>

<p>Grate men should only allow their most trusty friends tew
see them in their hours ov relaxashun.</p>

<p>I sumtimes distinguish between tallent and genius in this
way: A man ov tallent kan make a whissell out of a pig’s tale,
but it takes a man of genius tew make the tale.</p>

<p>I kant tell now whether a goose stands on one leg so mutch
to rest the leg az to rest the goose. I wish sum scientifick
man would tell me all about this.</p>

<p>Thare iz a mitey site ov difference whether Mr. John Smith
will appear at Booth’s Theater az Othello, or whether Othello
will appear az Mr. John Smith.</p>

<p>I had rather be a child again than to be the autokrat ov the

<p>Thare iz newmerous individuals in the land who look upon
what they hain’t got az the only things worth having.</p>

<p>Thare iz thoze who kant laff with impunity; if they aint

<p>A fu branes in a man’s hed are az noizy az shot in a blown
up bladder.</p>

<p>One man ov genius to 97 thousand four hundred and 42
men ov tallent iz just about the rite perporshun for aktual
bizzness.</p>

<p>I hate grate talkers; i had rather hav a swarm ov bees lite
onto me.</p>

<p>Adam and Eve were very good kind ov pholks until they
were tempted, and then they kerflumixt immediately.</p>

<p>Ventilashun iz a good thing, but when a man kant lay
down and sleep in a 10 aker lot without taking down two
lengths ov fence to let the wind in he iz alltogether too airish.</p>

<p>I hav finally made up mi mind tew do a good turn whenever
i kan, even if i git histed higher than a kite for it.</p>

<p>I think that a hen who undertakes tew lay 2 eggs a day
must necessarily neglekt sum other branch ov bizzness.</p>

<p>He who really deserves friends alwus finds them.</p>

<p>Thare is “menny a slip between a cup and lip,” but not haff
az menny az thare ought tew be.</p>

<p>The two most important words in enny languarge are the
shortest—“Yes” and “No.”</p>

<p>One ov the most honest and reliable men i kno ov at the
present time iz “Old Probabilitiz;” he iz an ornament and
honor tew hiz sex.</p>

<p>Men hav more vanity than wimmin, and wimmin hav more
jealousy than men.</p>

<p>Rather than not hav faith in enny thing, i am willing tew
be beat 9 times out ov 10.</p>

<p>In whipping a yung one, yu don’t never ought tew stop
untill yu git klean thru.</p>

<p>I dont never hav enny trubble in regulating mi own kondukt,

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">I</span> pitty</span> the poor Interviewer, he iz not alwus a bad phellow
at heart, but hiz trade iz a mean one, and the bizzness haz
spilte him.</p>

<p>I would rather lead a blind mule on the tow-path for a living,
or retail soft klams from a ricketty waggon, than tew be
an Interviewer, and worry people with questions, they waz
afrade tew answer and too vain tew refuse.</p>

<p>The Interviewer iz a human hosstrich, feeding on enny
thing he kan find, and digesting eazy enny thing he can
swallo.</p>

<p>He iz a kind ov kultivated hyena, and makes yu shudder
to think, that at enny moment, he may turn wild and begin
tew hunt for a human beefstake.</p>

<p>He haz just branes enuff tew keep hiz impudence aktiv,
and tho he haz but little malice, he will hunt yu sharper, and
worry yu wuss, than a canal boat bedbug.</p>

<p>He iz like a ritch cheeze, chuck phull ov little things.</p>

<p>Thare iz no eskaping this breed ov kritters, if yu run they
will overtake yu, if yu steal into yure hole they will either
dig for yu, or stand around on the outside till yu cum out.</p>

<p>They are wuss than a flea tew a long-haired dog.</p>

<p>Interviewers are a cross between the old-fashioned <i>quid
nunk</i> and the modern Buzzer, and are a pesky improvement
on both.</p>

<p>Death itself iz no eskape from the Interviewer, for they
<span id="pg_321" class="page_anchor">321 </span>
will hang around the departure till they git an item, and then
go for the widow.</p>

<p>The Interviewer would rather tell the truth if he kan, but
aint discouraged if he iz forced tew tell what aint so.</p>

<p>They are az dangerous tew admit into yure konfidence az
a pickpocket iz, not bekause they will take enny spoons, but
bekauze yu are haff afrade they will.</p>

<p>Modesty would ruin an Interviewer, delikasy would unfit
him for bizzness, he kan even thrive without being honest,
and tew make him
an adept in hiz calling,
he dont require
enny more tenderness
than an undertaker
duz.</p>

<p>Yu kan git rid ov
a hornet by brakeing
his nek, yu kan
outrun a blak snaik,
and kan hide from
the sheriff, but the
Interviewer, like the
cursid muskeeter in
the dark, hovers
around yu, and if he
don’t bight, he sings,
which is the wusstest
ov the two.</p>

<p>I hav bin lit onto
by the Interviewer miself, and hav answered hiz questions,
az honest az ever a child did the katekism, and the next day
read the dialogue in the morning paper, and it waz all az new
to me az Old Probabilitiz log ov the weather.</p>

<p>Don’t never tell any sekrets tew an Interviewer; he will
open them az they open oysters in the market, and retail
them on the haff shell.</p>

<p>I treat all interviewers politely; when they begin tew bait
<span id="pg_322" class="page_anchor">322 </span>
me, i ask them tew smoke (i never knu one to refuse), and
when they press me too clussly then i begin tew whissell.</p>

<p>I am an awful poor whissler enny how.</p>

<p>I do really pitty the poor Interviewer; he works for hiz
bread like enny other skribbler, and for what i kno, hates the
bizzness, but i am sad when I say, that if he iz good at interviewing,
he iz too impudent tew be good for enny thing else.</p>

<p>Sum people luv tew be interviewed, and i must say, theze
kind of pholks never reach the dignity ov impudence; they
are simply disgusting.</p>

<p>Yu kant git a journeyman Interviewer tew waste enny
time on sutch stale goods; he would az soon think of interviewing
a last year’s birds’ nest, or a kuntry gide-board.</p>

<p>Thare iz no kure for a reglar Interviewer; he thirsts for
the game like a fox hound on the trak; he livs upon plunder,
and would rather be sent up for 30 daze than to see hiz collum
in the morning Gazzette without a trophy.</p>

<p>He iz amphibikuss, and kan liv on the land a good deal
longer than he kan liv under the water.</p>

<p>He feeds upon roots, herbs, and soft klams, and smells like
the wake of a fashionable woman out on parade.</p>

<p>He bilds houses in the winter, about az big az flour barrels,
all over the marshes, and enters them from the cellar.</p>

<p>Hiz phur iz worth just about 25 cents, and aint lively in
market at that.</p>

<p>Yu kan ketch them in allmoste enny kind ov a trap that
haz got a way tew git into it. They are not kunning, and
aint diffikult tew suit.</p>

<p>When i waz a boy i trapped every winter for musk rats,
<span id="pg_323" class="page_anchor">323 </span>
and bought the fust pare ov skates i ever owned with their
skins.</p>

<p>I hav seen them in winter setting up on end on the ice,
cluss beside their holes, az stiff az an ezklamashun point, and
when they see me they change ends and point down, like a
semicolon, and that waz the last ov them.</p>

<p>The musk rat haz a flat tale, with no more phur on it than
a file haz.</p>

<p>I dont dispize musk rat—oh, no!—but i dont worship him.</p>

<p>He haz but phew sins tew answer for; the chief one iz
digging holes in the bank of the Erie kanal, and letting the
water brake out. He will hav tew answer for this sumtime.</p>

<p>I luv all the animals, all the bugs, all the beasts, all the insex,
all the katterpillars, bekauze they are so natral. They
are az mutch, if not more, an evidence tew me ov the existance,
the power, and the luv, ov an overruling Providence,
as man iz.</p>

<p>I kan see az mutch fust klass natur in an angleworm,
akording tew the square inch, az i kan see in an elephant.</p>

<p>I luv tew go phooling around amung the animiles ov all
kinds in a warm day; i had rather set down bi the side ov an
ant hill and see the whole swarm pitch onto a lazy kuss who
won’t work, and run him out ov the diggins, than tew set six
hours at the opera and applaud what i don’t understand, and
weep at the spot whare the rest do, and pay 3 dollars for the
privilege ov doing it.</p>

<h2 id="sec-137">THE MINK.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> mink iz about fourth cuzzin tew the musk rat, and haz
sum things in common with him; they both smell alike.</p>

<p>He iz one ov yure land and water citizens, and kan dive
deeper, do it quicker, and kum out dryer than enny thing i
kno ov.</p>

<span id="pg_324" class="page_anchor">324 </span>

<p>His phur iz one ov the luxurys ov the present generashun
and iz worth az mutch akording tew its size as one dollar
bills are.</p>

<p>He haz no very strong pekuliarity ov karakter except hiz
perfume, which iz about haff way in its smell between the
beaver and the musk rat.</p>

<p>The mink haz 4 times the kunning that the musk rat haz,
and iz bilt long and slim like a little girl’s stocking.</p>

<p>They are not handy tew ketch, but when ketched are
skinned whole.</p>

<p>I hav trapt a good deal for mink and hav kaught them
mity little, for they are almost az hard tew ketch in a trap
and keep thare as a ray ov light iz.</p>

<p>Thare iz sum people who hav et mink, and sed it waz good,
but i wouldn’t beleave sutch a man under oath, not bekauze
he ment tew lie, but bekauze he didn’t kno what the truth
waz.</p>

<p>I et a piece ov biled wilekat once, and that haz lasted me
ever since, but i never waz parshall tew wild meat ennyhow.</p>

<p>I lived 25 years ov mi life whare game ov all kinds waz
plenty. We had bear, oppossum, buffalo and rattlesnaik, and
then nights we had draw poker and hi lo Jak, just tew waste
the time a leetle.</p>

<h2 id="sec-138">THE DISTRIKT SKOOLMASTER.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>hare</span> iz one man in this basement world that i alwus
look upon with mixt pheelings ov pitty and respekt.</p>

<p><i>Pitty</i> and <i>respekt</i>, az a genral mixtur, don’t mix well.</p>

<p>You will find them both traveling around amungst folks,
but not growing on the same bush.</p>

<p>When they do hug each other, they mean sumthing.</p>

<p>Pitty, without respekt, hain’t got much more oats in it than
disgust haz.</p>

<p>I had rather a man would hit me on the side ov the hed
than tew pitty me.</p>

<span id="pg_325" class="page_anchor">325 </span>

<p>But thare iz one man in this world to whom i alwus take
oph mi hat, and remain uncovered untill he gits safely by,
and that iz the distrikt skoolmaster.</p>

<p>When I meet him, I look upon him az a martyr just returning
from the stake, or on hiz way thare tew be cooked.</p>

<p>He leads a more lonesum and single life than an old bachelor,
and a more anxious one than an old maid.</p>

<p>He iz remembered jist about az long and affektionately az
a gide board iz by a traveling pack pedlar.</p>

<p>If he undertakes tew make hiz skollars luv him, the chances
are he will neglekt their larning; and if he don’t lick them
now and then pretty often, they will soon lick him.</p>

<p>The distrikt skoolmaster hain’t got a friend on the flat side
ov earth. The boys snow-ball him during recess; the girls
put water in hiz hair die; and the skool committee make him
work for haff the money a bartender gits, and board him
around the naberhood, whare they giv him rhy coffee, sweetened
with mollassis, tew drink, and kodfish bawls 3 times a
day for vittles.</p>

<p>And, with all this abuse, I never heard ov a distrikt skoolmaster
swareing enny thing louder than—<i>Condem it</i>.</p>

<p>Don’t talk tew me about the pashunce ov anshunt Job.</p>

<p>Job had pretty plenty ov biles all over him, no doubt, but
they were all ov one breed.</p>

<p>Every yung one in a distrikt skool iz a bile ov a diffrent
breed, and each one needs a diffrent kind ov poultiss tew git
a good head on them.</p>

<p>A distrikt skoolmaster, who duz a square job and takes hiz
codfish bawls reverently, iz a better man to day tew hav lieing
around loose than Soloman would be arrayed in all ov hiz
glory.</p>

<p>Soloman waz better at writing proverbs and manageing a
large family, than he would be tew navigate a distrikt skool
hous.</p>

<p>Enny man who haz kept a distrikt skool for ten years, and
boarded around the naberhood, ought tew be made a mager
gineral, and hav a penshun for the rest ov hiz natral days,
and a hoss and waggin tew do hiz going around in.</p>

<span id="pg_326" class="page_anchor">326 </span>

<p>But, az a genral consequence, a distrikt skoolmaster hain’t
got any more warm friends than an old blind fox houn haz.</p>

<p>He iz jist about az welkum az a tax gatherer iz.</p>

<p>He is respekted a good deal az a man iz whom we owe a
debt ov 50 dollars to and don’t mean tew pay.</p>

<p>He goes through life on a back road, az poor az a wood sled,
and finally iz missed—but what ever bekums ov hiz remains,
i kant tell.</p>

<p>Fortunately he iz not often a sensitive man; if he waz, he
couldn’t enny more keep a distrikt skool than he could file a
kross kut saw.</p>

<p>Whi iz it that theze men and wimmen, who pashuntly and
with crazed brain teach our remorseless brats the tejus meaning
ov the alphabet, who take the fust welding heat on their
destinys, who lay the stepping stones and enkurrage them tew
mount upwards, who hav dun more hard and mean work than
enny klass on the futstool, who have prayed over the reprobate,
strengthened the timid, restrained the outrageous, and
flattered the imbecile, who hav lived on kodfish and vile coffee,
and hain’t been heard to sware—whi iz it that they are treated
like a vagrant fiddler, danced to for a night, paid oph in the
morning, and eagerly forgotten?</p>

<p>I had rather burn a coal pit, or keep the flys out ov a
butcher’s shop in the month ov August, than meddle with the
distrikt skool bizzness.</p>

<h2 id="sec-139">SINGULAR BEINGS.</h2>

<h3 id="sec-139-1">THE POMPOUS MAN.</h3>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> pompous man iz generally a snob at home and abroad.</p>

<p>He fills himself up with an east wind and thinks he iz grate
just bekauze he happens tew feel big.</p>

<p>He talks loud and large, but deceives noboddy who will
take the trubble tew meazzure him.</p>

<p>He iz a man ov small <i>caliber</i>, but a good deal ov <i>bore</i>.</p>

<span id="pg_327" class="page_anchor">327 </span>

<p>Hiz family looks upon him az the gratest man that the
world haz had the honor to produce lately, and tho he gits
snubbed often amungst folks, lie rekompenses himself bi
going home and snubbing hiz family.</p>

<h3 id="sec-139-2">THE ONE IDEA MAN.</h3>

<div class="illustration" id="ill-57">
<a href="images/ill-58.jpg"><img src="images/ill-58_min.jpg" alt=""></a>
<p class="caption">THE YANKEE, THAT IS ALWAYS REDDY TO ARGUE
THE QUESTION.</p>
</div>

<p>The one idea man iz like the merino ram, he shuts up both
eyes and goze for things
inkontinently. He
misses, ov course, oftener
than he hits, but
don’t kno the difference,
and is always
reddy to argue the
question. Yu kant
konvince him that he
iz wrong enny more
than you kan a hornet.</p>

<p>One idea men are
their own wust enemys,
and there iz but
one kure for them, and
that iz tew agree with
them. If yu think just
az they do, they will
soon want tew think
sum other way, and that lets two ideas git into their hed,
which makes them perhaps endurable.</p>

<h3 id="sec-139-3">THE HAPPY MAN.</h3>

<p>The happy man iz a poor judge of hiz own bliss, for he
kant set down and deskribe it.</p>

<p>Happiness iz like helth—thoze who hav the most ov it
seem tew kno it the least.</p>

<p>Yu kant go out in the spring ov the year and gather happiness
along the side ov the road just the same az you would
<span id="pg_328" class="page_anchor">328 </span>
dandylions—noboddy but a natral born phool kan do this
they are alwus happy, ov course.</p>

<p>When i hear a man bragging how happy he iz, he dont
cheat me, he only cheats himself.</p>

<h3 id="sec-139-4">THE HENPECKED MAN.</h3>

<p>The henpecked man iz most generally married; but thare
are instances on reckord of single men being harrassed by the
pullets.</p>

<p>Yu kan alwus tell one ov theze kind ov men, espeshily if
they are in the company ov their wives. They look az humble
and resighned tew their fate az a hen turkey in a wet
day.</p>

<p>Thare aint nothing that will take the starch out ov a man
like being pecked by a woman. It is wuss than a seven months’
turn ov the fever and agy.</p>

<p>The wives ov hen-pecked husbands most alwus out liv their
viktims, and I hav known them tew git marrid agin, and git
hold ov a man that time (<i>thank the Lord!</i>) who understood all
the hen-peck dodges.</p>

<p>One ov these kind ov husbands iz an honor tew his sex.</p>

<p>The hen-pecked man, when he gits out amungst men, puts
on an air ov bravery and defiance, and once in a while will
git a leetle drunk, and then go home with a firm resolve that
he will be captain ov his household; but the old woman soon
takes the glory out ov him, and handles him just az she would
a haff-grown chicken, who had fell into the swill barrel, and
had tew be jerked out dredful quick.</p>

<h3 id="sec-139-5">THE OFFICIOUS MAN.</h3>

<p>The officious man stands around rubbing his hands, anxious
for a job.</p>

<p>He seems tew ake for sumthing tew do, and if he gits snubbed
in one place, it don’t seem tew diskourage him, but like
the fly, he lights on another.</p>

<p>The officious man iz az free from malice as a young pup,
who, if he kant do anything else, iz reddy tew lay down in
front of yu and be stept on.</p>

<span id="pg_329" class="page_anchor">329 </span>

<p>Theze kind ov men spend their whole lives trieing tew make
friends ov all, and never succeed with any.</p>

<p>There iz a kind ov officious man, who iz only prompted bi
his vanity, hiz anxiety tew be useful tew others don’t arise
from enny goodness ov heart, but simply from a desire ov
stiking hiz noze into things.</p>

<p>Theze kind ov individuals are supremely disgusting.</p>

<p>The officious man iz generally ov no use whatever tew himself,
and a nusance tew everyboddy else.</p>

<p>I don’t know ov but phew more unfortunit disposishuns
than the officious mans, for even in its very best phase, it seldom
suckceedes in gitting paid for its labors with common
politeness.</p>

<h3 id="sec-139-6">THE PHUNNY MAN.</h3>

<p>Thare iz hardly ennything that a man iz so vain ov az the
humor that iz in him.</p>

<p>The <i>phunny man</i> iz seldum an humorist, and never a wit.</p>

<p>Hiz only pride iz tew make you laff; he seldum rizes abuv
a jest, and very often iz the only one who kan see enny point
even in that.</p>

<p>He iz generally the hero ov the ockashun in the rural distrikts,
and kuntry bumbkins laff obstreprous whenever he
opens his mouth.</p>

<p>The phunny man iz the clown at large, and hiz jests are
sumtimes amuzing, but never remembered.</p>

<p>Thare iz seldum enny taint ov originality in him, and the
quips and the quirks he deals in are old saws reset and refiled,
and bad enuff done at that.</p>

<p>It iz a dredful unfortunit thing tew deal in cast oph jokes;
for, like the old clothes bizzness, they will stick tew a man
all thru life.</p>

<h3 id="sec-139-7">THE CHEEKY MAN.</h3>

<p>Impudence, or sumthing like it, iz the leading trait in most
suckcessful mens karakters.</p>

<p>All the nice things that hav bin sed in favour ov modesty,
<span id="pg_330" class="page_anchor">330 </span>
fail tew stand the test when brought into the pull and haul of
every-day life.</p>

<p>Bold assurance, while it may often disgust us; will win 9
times out ov 10.</p>

<p>We all ov us praze the modest, but our praze iz only a kind
ov pitty, and pitty will ruin enny man.</p>

<p>Enny man will liv four times az long on abuse, and git phatt,
az he will on pitty.</p>

<p>Thare iz now and then a man who iz modest, but intensely
in earnest, and sutch men sweep everything before them.</p>

<p>The karakter ov the modest man iz a good thing, and a
butiful thing tew frame and hang up in a private apartment,
but experience teaches us that if we wait for our turn in this
world, <i>our turn</i> never seems tew come round.</p>

<p>The cheeky man never enjoys thoze delightful sensations
which arize from having yielded tew others; hiz logick iz that
the arly bird gits the worm, and, regardless ov all delikasy,
he goze for the worm.</p>

<p>Thare seems tew be nothing now daze that will warrant
sukcess like cheek, and the more cheek the better, even if you
hav az mutch as a mule.</p>

<h3 id="sec-139-8">THE LIVE MAN.</h3>

<p>The <i>Live Man</i> iz like the little pig; he iz weaned young,
and begins tew root arly.</p>

<p>He iz the pepper-sass ov creation—the all-spice ov the world.</p>

<p>One <i>Live Man</i> in a village is like a case ov itch in a distrikt
skool—he sets evry boddy scratching at onst.</p>

<p>A man who kan draw New Orleans molasses in the month
ov January, thru a half inch augur-hole, and sing “Home!
sweet home!” while the molasis iz running, may be strictly
honest, but he aint sudden enuff for this climate.</p>

<p>The Live Man iz az full ov bizness az the conducter ov a
street kar—he iz often like a hornet, very bizzy, but about
what, the Lord only knows.</p>

<p>He lights up like a cotton faktory, and haint got enny more
time tew spare than a skool-boy has Saturday afternoons.</p>

<span id="pg_331" class="page_anchor">331 </span>

<p>He is like a decoy duck, alwus above water, and lives at
least 18 months each year.</p>

<p>He is like a runaway hoss; he gits the whole ov the road.</p>

<p>He trots when he walks, and lies down at night only bekauze
everyboddy else duz.</p>

<p>The live man is not always a deep thinker; he jumps at
conclusions, just as the frog duz, and don’t alwus land at the
spot he is looking at.</p>

<p>He is the Amerikan pet, a perfekt mystery tew foreigners;
but he has done more (with charcoal) tew work out the greatness
of this country than any other man in it.</p>

<p>He is jist as necessary as the grease on an axle-tree.</p>

<p>He don’t alwus die ritch, but alwus dies bizzy, and meets
death a good deal az an oyster duz, without making enny fuss.</p>

<h3 id="sec-139-9">THE FAULT-FINDER.</h3>

<p>Good Lord, deliver us from the Falt finder, one ov yure
kronick grunters, i mean. Theze kind ov human critters
are alwuss full ov self consait; if tha waz humble and
wud dam themself okasionally, i wud try tew pity them.
Yure falt-finding old-bachelor, for instanze, odars a pair ov
No. 8 boots, and then kolides with his shumaker insted ov his
big feet; he walks tew the depo tew saive hack-hire and
misses the trane, and then kolides with the time-table; he
kourts a gal till she has tew marry sumboddy else tew keep
from spileing, and then he don’t believe thare is a vartuous
woman living. If he enjoys ennything he dus it under protess,
and if ennyboddy else enjoys ennything he knows tha
lie about it. He is like a seckund rate bull tarrier, alwus a
fiteing, and alwus gitting licked. These kind ov critters never
are reddy tew die, bekause tha haint never begun tew live. I
never maik their ackquaintanse enny more than i dew sumboddy’s
small pox, bekause i am a looking after bright things
and haint got enny to lose. Thare aint enny remedee for this
dissease but hunger, and that aint parmanent unless it results
in starvashun. Good Lord, deliver us from the falt-finder!
if yu undertake tew argy with them yu onla flatter them, and
<span id="pg_332" class="page_anchor">332 </span>
if yu jine in with them yu onla maik them mad with them
selfs.</p>

<p>I had rather be a target for awl the bad luk in this wurld
than tew go thru life shuteing a pizen arrow at awl the good
luk. The more i think ov it, the more i keep thinking that
falt-finding iz verry much like bobing for eels with a raw
potater; a fust rate wa tew git out ov consait ov awl kinds ov
fishing, and a fust rate wa not tew ketch enny eels.</p>

<p>Thare are many singular beins in this world, but i fancy
the singularest are the<span class="hidden"> spinsters.</span></p>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">Y</span>u</span> inform me, mi dear sir, that yu are a member ov the
sosiety “for the prevenshun ov kruelty tew animiles.”</p>

<p>Allow me tew simpathize with yu, bi saying, that i am glad
ov it.</p>

<p>It iz a nobel institushun, and stands <i>ahed</i> ov the prevenshun
ov kruelty tew humans.</p>

<span id="pg_333" class="page_anchor">333 </span>

<p>It iz a fakt, that thoze who are kind tew animiles, are kind
tew humans.</p>

<p>I am not acquainted with Mr. Bergh, the president ov yure
assosiashun, whom yu speak ov so kindly, i dont kno him
personally, but i kno him at a distance, he is very tall.</p>

<p>In yure letter tew me, yu speak very tenderly about the
Injuns, and ask me, “if thare aint sum way, tew alleviate the
condishun ov the nobel red man on our frontier.”</p>

<p>Yu say yu are willing tew bekum a missionary, and go
amung them, and labur for their good.</p>

<p>The injun, mi dear sir, iz a pekuliar kuss.</p>

<p>He haz the most ardent simpathizers amung thoze who
dont kno him the muchest.</p>

<p>In the komposishun ov the skool girl, the injun maiden
bekums a brik, and when the boys speak about him, they
speak ov his bo and arrows, and hiz nobel natur.</p>

<p>Most people kno the injun from the Hiawatha stand point,
but i git mi informashun from the kritter himself.</p>

<p>I dont liv amungst him now, but in the early years ov mi
misfortunes, in this latitude, i bekum striktly acquainted with
the nobel injun az he iz, not so mutch az he ought tew be,
nor az poets hav tost him up.</p>

<p>I hav saw him in hiz natiff buty at home, and hav mi
opinyun ov him, which i am willing tew impart tew yu, at
fust cost.</p>

<p>Mi advice tew yu, iz tew stay with Mr. Bergh, and stick
tew the stage hoss, and make him az comfortable az yu kan,
and not waste enny philanthropy, nor hallelujah, on the border
injun.</p>

<p>Thare ain’t a more villainous individual, now loafing around
loose, on the footstool, than Mr. Lo, the injun.</p>

<p>The minnit an injun bekums what yu kall civilized, that
minnit he iz spilte.</p>

<p>A civilized injun aint ov enny more use tew himself, az a
means ov grace, nor ennyboddy else, than a tame deer.</p>

<p>If thare could be found an iland, in the depths of the sea,
whare it waz sure, no white man, nor blak man, nor blue man,
<span id="pg_334" class="page_anchor">334 </span>
would ever go, it mite do tew stock it, with the injuns now
residing on our border, and let them civilize each other.</p>

<p>I am willing tew admit, thare iz a difference in the various
tribes ov injuns.</p>

<p>Sum are wuss than others, but civilizashun haz never been
ov enny uze tew an injun.</p>

<p>If yu ask enny border man, one who knos the kritters, he
will tell yu the same story.</p>

<p>Sunday skools are a good place tew learn the katekism, and
git the hang ov the 10 commandments, but tew kno the injun,
mi dear sir, yu must go amungst him.</p>

<p>Yu kant studdy injun, and lay around a meeting house all
the time, i am sorry for this, but i dont konsider that i am
tew blame for it.</p>

<p>As i sed above, stick tew the omnibust hoss, he iz, in mi
opinyun, a more fit, and better paying investment, for yure
kindness, than the best Blackfeet injun thare iz now in the
rocky mountains.</p>

<p>If yu should go amungst this tribe, az a fust class missionary,
yu mite eskape with yure life, and possibly with yure
skalp, if yu did, you would have sumthing tew brag ov, the
rest ov yure life.</p>

<p>The grate trubble iz, the injun wont larn the virtews ov
civilizashun, he iz satisfied with larning the vices, and only
studdiz how tew improve on them.</p>

<p>Kruelty, and deceit, are the leading artikles in an injuns
natur, and yu mite az well undertaik tew break the wiggle
out ov a snaix, or the sting out ov a hornet, az tew git theze
two vices out ov enny specimen ov human natur, when they
form the basis ov karakter.</p>

<p>Kindness towards an injun, is no gurantee ov safety.</p>

<p>When yu are amungst injuns, keep yure hand on yure
revolver, and yure eye over yure shoulder.</p>

<p>When i waz a very pretty boy, and fust began tew dwell
amung romances, i red menny ov the tales, told so well, about
the injun, and thought, how i would like tew be an nobel
injun, and hav a wigwam, and foller the bounding deer, and
<span id="pg_335" class="page_anchor">335 </span>
lay mi venson at the feet ov a dark komplekted buty, and
several more things, ov this prerswashun, but sum years after,
i found miself on the trail, and had all the injun poetry taken
out ov me, never more tew cum back.</p>

<p>I dont wish tew hurt ennyboddys aktual pheelings, who
have made up their minds, that the injun iz a nobel kritter, but
i will say tew them,
stay at home, and enjoy
yure sentiments.</p>

<p>Dont go amung
the nobel red man,
now on our frontier,
but stay at home, and
write sum stanzas
about him, and civilize
him at a distance.</p>

<p>I hav never had
but one plan tew civilize
the injun, since
i hav got old enuff
tew do him enny
good, and this plan
iz more unique, than
elegant.</p>

<p>Mi plan iz simpli
thus,—let the government offer 10 dollars for every injun civilized,
and let the proof ov civilizashun be the hair ov the
injuns head, with the skin attached tew it.</p>

<p>Now menny folks will hold up their hands, in number one
horror, at this plan, but i will bet on the plan.</p>

<p>This iz the only way tew civilize the kind ov injun that i
am a talking ov, and not hav tew do the work over agin.</p>

<p>I dont klaim tew be the original pattentee ov this plan ov
civilizashun, sumthing like it occurred in the palmy daze ov
Noah, when the best plan for civilizashun, that could be
thought ov, waz tew wipe out the whole race ov human beings
and make sum more.</p>

<span id="pg_336" class="page_anchor">336 </span>

<p>This iz mi plan, for noble red men, on the frontier, wipe
them out, but here i pauze, i say, dont make enny more.</p>

<p>Try sum other breed ov human kritter.</p>

<p>Mi opinyun, mi dear sir, about the missionary bizzness,
haz alwus bin, that it iz a profitable bizzness, well followed,
but thare iz several good ways tew do it, and several good
men tew invest in the undertaking.</p>

<p>Sum are kalkulated tew make the good better, sum are kalkulated
tew make the better almost perfekt, but thare aint
but phew, ov the right bore, kalkulated tew work in the vineyard
ov the wild border savage, and thoze, are theze, whoze
piety konsists, in shooting at a mark, and hitting the bull’s
eye every time.</p>

<p>I say once more, mi friend, stick to the omnibust hoss, and
let thoze missionarys, on the borders, the skalps ov whoze
wifes, and children, are now hung up az trophys in the wigwams
ov the nobel red man, let them civilize the injuns.</p>

<p>They will do it so that it will stay did.</p>

<p>I am the last man tew throw enny thing in the way ov
yure gitting a good job, espeshily in the missionary bizzness,
but i kant reckomend enny man, tew this partikular situashun,
unless i kno he understands the use ov a gain twist rifle, and
kan civilize a Pawnee, every time, 440 yards, with a cross
wind.</p>

<h2 id="sec-141">THE CUNNING MAN.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">C</span>unning</span> iz often took for wisdum, but it iz the mere
skum that rizes when wisdum biles her pot, it hath not the
stride ov wisdum, neither haz it the honesty ov wisdum, it iz
more like instinkt, than it iz like reazon.</p>

<p>Cunning ain’t good at begetting, it iz better at executing,
it iz like the wisdum ov a kat, fust rate tew watch a rat hole.</p>

<p>The cunning man haz two virtues alwus prominent, patience,
and energy, without these he would fall below the kat, and
fail tew git hiz mouse.</p>

<span id="pg_337" class="page_anchor">337 </span>

<p>Thare iz lots ov cunning men who are like an unskillful
trapper, who knows how tew set a trap, but hain’t got the wisdum
tew bait it.</p>

<p>Cunning men alwus hav a speciality, such az it iz, i hav
seen them who could ride a mule tew a spot, but who set a
hoss awkwardly.</p>

<p>Thare iz this average between a cunning man and a wise
man, the cunning man’s wisdum iz alwus on the outside ov
hiz face, he kant hide it, it iz alwus squirting out ov the corner
ov his eyes, while the wize man carrys hiz grist deep,
stowed away in hiz heart, and don’t use hiz wisdum tew find
ockasions, but tew master them, when they pop up.</p>

<p>Cunning men have grate caution, bekauze they serpoze
themselfs watched, inasmutch az they are alwus watching
others.</p>

<p>They hav but few brains, but what they hav, are petroleum,
and their brains being few, and greasy, enables them
tew fetch them tew a focus sudden.</p>

<p>It iz hard work to be very cunning and very honest, at the
same time, i reckon this, bekauze i dont see the two hugging
and kissing each other very much.</p>

<p>Cunning haz a skandalous pedigree, he iz the babe ov
wisdum, and Fraud, and iz the only child they ever had, but
looks and ackts just like his ma.</p>

<p>It would take a big book tew make an almanack ov a cunning
man, and the changes in him, fits, starts, and doubles,
and hiz windings, hiz in’s and hiz outs, the parables in which
he talks, and the double entenders ov hiz face, awl that he
duz, and awl that he thinks, are for effekt.</p>

<p>Cunning men’s advice iz hard tew follow, bekause their
wisdum iz made like a bed quilt, out ov patches, and iz also
composed ov shifts, for the emergincy ov an ockasion, tew
mutch for a stiddy diet.</p>

<p>If you don’t understand wiggling yourself, or the rudiments
ov it, yu must not git yure advice from the cunning
man.</p>

<p>Cunning haz alwus passed for wisdum, and will continue
<span id="pg_338" class="page_anchor">338 </span>
on to do so, az long az phools last, and phools will last az long
az enny boddy else duz, and sustane their reputashun.</p>

<p>Cunning iz alwus selfish, bekauze it iz not ov mutch
breadth, while wisdum can afford tew be magnanimous, and
hav sumthing left over.</p>

<p>But the ways and dodges ov cunning are past finding out,
yu might az well undertake tew track a snake in the grass,
when the dew iz off, or a fox, in a straight line tew hiz hole.</p>

<p>Cunning men are not very dangerous, they hav so mutch
vanity, and their vanity satisfied their ambition iz, and when
vanity takes the place ov ambishun, we are more amuzed than
alarmed.</p>

<p>Cunning men, in the hands ov wize men, are useful, more
useful, quite often, than honesty, bekauze they are more sudden,
and less sempelous.</p>

<p>It is safer tew entrust a sekret tew a cunning man, than a
clever man, the clever man is sure tew spill it, the cunning
one may use it aginst yu, but he iz eazier tew watch, and control,
than the good natured fellow, who, like a young pup,
lays down, rools over, and wags himself in front ov evry man
he meets.</p>

<p>Cunning men hav manny associates, but few intimates, they
sumtimes hunt in couples, but are apt tew fight, when they
cum to divide the plunder.</p>

<p><i>The Deceitful Cuss.</i>—An open enemy, a hearty hater, a
bold dead-beater, an imperious friend, a phoolish chum, a
reckless companyun, anything in shape ov human, or ov brute,
and even aul things devlish, are mince pies with raizins in
them, compared tew a slipping, sneaking <i>Deceit</i>, who, under
the guize and garments ov being in love with you, chaws tobbaker
out ov yure box, and lies tew yu evry time he tells yu
the truth.</p>

<p>Theze human polecats are thick in this world, their eyes
are like the kats, made tew see in the dark, they hav the face
ov a sheep, and the heart ov a snaik, they kan kry at an impromptu
christening, they are az full ov cunning az a she
opposum, and would rather fail in an enterprise than to do it
honestly.</p>

<span id="pg_339" class="page_anchor">339 </span>

<p>These critters, az awkward as it may seem, are full ov vanity
and ambishun, and their vanity and ambishun iz tew play lion
under a sheep’s skin.</p>

<p>It iz a strange ambishun that a man will cultivate wisdum
only for the sake ov being cunning, that he will perfect himself
in the art and imagery of love and friendship for the sake
ov counterfitting them, that he will studdy pitty for gain, that
he will work hard for the devil at 2 shillings a day, and finally,
that he will practiss the rudiments ov awl the virtews ov
soshul life, simply for the sake ov doing with a good grace
what iz shameful and wicked to do at all.</p>

<p>I hav <ins title="Note: “know” in the original" id="cg_64">known</ins> men ov this brand, who where not wholly
malishus, who would aktually dew yu a good turn to-morrow
if they could cheat yu to-day, who deceive not entirely for
gain, but tew keep their tools whet, who hav sum excellent
traits, which sumtimes drop out seemingly by mistake.</p>

<p>But a natral crook toward deception iz like the bight ov a
mad dogg, it may sleep for a long time in the veins ov its
viktim, very well behaved pizen, watching for a good time,
but sooner or later, when least expekted, the virus begins tew
play dorg by asserting its dredful prerogative.</p>

<p>It don’t cure theze vermin tew ketch them, if they waz
rats, which we could drown in the trap, it would be bully, but
letting them go only makes them the more cunning.</p>

<p>Deception iz one ov the sciences, it haz its deakons, elders
and hod carriers, the world swarms with them, all ov the
pimps among them, such az the wodden nutmeg makers, and
the small beer-cheats, we kan punish enuff by dispising, but
what reward, short ov the gibbet, or at least the whipping
post, iz equal tew the villainous cuss who creeps on hiz body
into yure confidense, a subdued and shivering snake, and
warms up into a viper.</p>

<p>Ingratitude iz one ov them diabolikal crimes that awl men
hate, but leave the punishment to heaven.</p>

<p>The <i>Domestik Man</i> iz ov a maskuline and feminine tendency—half
and half—and sumtimes more so.</p>

<p>He kan most generally be found at home—when he aint
wanted.</p>

<span id="pg_340" class="page_anchor">340 </span>

<p>He iz a kind ov second lutennant in hiz family, under haff
pay, with promiss of promoshun.</p>

<p>He kan beat hiz wife bileing soap, or nussing the baby, and
she kan beat him, in the 4th ward, running for perlice constabel.</p>

<p>He iz alwus reddy tew do ennything—when hiz wife iz.</p>

<p>He iz a kind ov spy in the household, and iz treated az such
by the whole family. The servants laff at him, and the children
dont fear him.</p>

<p>He iz az fierce as an old hen setting on one egg, and just
about az dangerous.</p>

<p>Hiz wife marrid him, not out ov love, but out ov pitty;
and pitty never changes into respekt, but gennerally into disgust.</p>

<p><i>The Generous Man.</i>—Generosity iz an instinkt—a kind ov
natral crook—a weird child ov the heart.</p>

<p>It iz diffrent from profusion; profusion iz most alwus the
decoy duck ov vanity.</p>

<p>Generosity iz diffrent from charity; charity iz the impulse
ov reason.</p>

<p>It iz diffrent from justiss—justiss iz 16 ounces tew the
pound, and no more.</p>

<p>Generosity iz sumthing more than justiss, and sumthing
less than profusion; it iz the good a man duz, without being
able tew give enny reazon for it.</p>

<p>If a man iz alwus genrous he will alwus be right, or will
hav a good excuse for what seems tew be wrong.</p>

<p>Generosity iz bravery, and it iz truth: no one ever saw a
generous man who waz a coward or a liar.</p>

<p>Generosity sumtimes may lack prudence, but it never lacks
faith, and faith haz won holier laurels than prudence ever did.</p>

<p>The generous man chastens hiz gifts with the assurance that
the giver iz az happy in the gift az the receiver iz.</p>

<p>He takes the fust swaller out ov the dipper, and smacking
hiz lips, insists upon your drinking the balance awl up.</p>

<p>Poverty haz no power over generosity enny more than it
haz over love.</p>

<span id="pg_341" class="page_anchor">341 </span>

<p>This iz my idee ov the kind ov generosity that I am writing
about.</p>

<h2 id="sec-142">FREQUENT KRITTERS.</h2>

<h3 id="sec-142-1">THE LOAFER.</h3>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> loafer iz a human being who iz willing tew be dispized
just for the privilege ov abuzing others.</p>

<p>He occupys all grades in sosiety, from the judge on the
bench klean doun to the ragged thing in britches who leans
aginst a lamp-post and fites flys in August.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill-60">
<a href="images/ill-61.jpg"><img src="images/ill-61_min.jpg" alt=""></a>
<p class="caption">FREQUENT KRITTERS.</p>
</div>

<p>He haz hiz circle ov friends, whare hiz koarse jests are re-echoed,
and whare
to be in hiz konfidence
iz konsidered
an honor.</p>

<p>He iz not alwus
destitute ov kommon
sense, and quite
often iz the author
ov jests which pass
upon the unwary for
humor and even wit.</p>

<p>He haz no pride
that is worthy, and
haz no delikasy that
enny boddy kan hurt.</p>

<p>During hiz boyhood
he kills kats
and sells their hides
to the hatters, and
robs all the hens’ nests and arly apple trees in the naborhood.</p>

<p>During hiz middle life he begs all the tobacco he uses, and
drinks all the cheap whisky he kan at sumboddy else’s expense.</p>

<p>During hiz old age he winters in the alms-houses, and summers
in the sugar hogsheds, and when he comes tew die he iz
<span id="pg_342" class="page_anchor">342 </span>
buried in a dich, like an omnibus hoss, with hiz old shoes on.</p>

<p>This iz a trew ackount ov the life and adventures ov
the ordinary loafer, and yet there are thousands ov human
kritters coming onto the platform ov life every six months
whoze only ambishun iz to be successful loafers.</p>

<p>The loafer kares nothing for publik opinyun, and this alone,
will make any man a loafer.</p>

<p>The loafer rather covets disgrace ov all kinds, and when a
man gits az low down az this, he haz got az low down az he
kan git without digging.</p>

<h3 id="sec-142-2">THE PROJEKTOR.</h3>

<p>The projektor iz a man with one idee, and that idee iz often
like a paving stun, the hardest kind ov a thing tew hatch out,
and when it iz hatched out, yu kan’t alwus tell what kind ov
a breed the thing iz.</p>

<p>He haz been bizzy at work for the last 4 thousand years
trieing tew bild perpetual moshun, and haz cum within 3
quarters ov an inch ov it sevral times, but alwus slips up jist
az he reaches out tew grab it.</p>

<p>He haz dun sum dredful good things for mankind, but too
often iz ov no more use in the world, than an extra pump iz.</p>

<p>The projektor iz alwus a man ov genius, but hiz genius iz
frequently like the genius ov a goose, thare ain’t no one kan
beat them at standing on one legg.</p>

<p>I hav known theze breed ov pholks tew drag out a long
life, richer in their own estimashun than Crœsus, and poorer
in the opinyun ov others than Lazarus.</p>

<p>They seldum reap enny gain from their invenshuns, and if
ever they do diskover perpetual moshun, they will sell the
principle tew sum kunning kuss, for 17 or 18 dollars, and
starve tew death on the glory ov it.</p>

<p>I hav known several ov these poor phellows in mi life, and
only knew them tew pitty them, for they are az tender, all
over, az spring lam, and az eazy tew cheat az a blind baby.</p>

<p>I hav a friend who iz a projektor. I kant tell what partikular
pholly he iz at work at now, but sum one I am sure, for
<span id="pg_343" class="page_anchor">343 </span>
thare aint on the whole arth, a more bizzy kritter than the
man, who iz sure that to-morrow will put the finishing touches
tew hiz pattent rite plan, for threading the rong end ov a
kambrik needle, or his resipee for making soft sope out ov
calfs liver.</p>

<p>But we kant spare the projektors, all that we can hope for
iz, that too menny ov them wont spend a whole life in making
a juse harp that will play Yankee doodle backwards, and
finally die, and leave the tune haff finished.</p>

<h3 id="sec-142-3">THE KONDEM PHOOL.</h3>

<p>Thare iz two kinds ov phools, at the date ov this article,
laying around loose in the world, one iz the <i>natral</i>, and the
other iz the <i>kondem</i>.</p>

<p>Thare iz sum other kind ov phools besides these, which I
shall tutch lightly before I git thru.</p>

<p>The natral phool kant help it, he iz born like the daizy, bi
the side ov the road, just to nod, and to be sport for the winds.</p>

<p>He haz no destiny to phill, that we know ov, but hiz Heavenly
Father will care for him, for He cares for the koarse
weed and the rank thissell.</p>

<p>The kondem phool iz a self-made man, and iz entitled tew
all the credit ov the job.</p>

<p>Natur turns him out loose into the world, jist as she duz
her other works, with all hiz fakultys in good order, but like
a ram in a bak lot, he undertaiks tew knok down a stun fence
with hiz head, and finds the stun fence too much for the ockashun.</p>

<p>He often haz a hed phull ov branes, but like a swarm ov
beeze, they keep up sich a buzzing they bewilder him.</p>

<p>The kondem phool generally lacks but one thing tew make
him all the the suckcess he could ask for, and that one thing
iz common sense.</p>

<p>Common sense iz all greek tew these kind ov phellows,
they kan often rite poetry that reads az smooth and sweet az
ile and molassis mixt together, and kan even deliver lekturs
all around the kuntry, but one dose ov common sense would
<span id="pg_344" class="page_anchor">344 </span>
take all the starch out ov them, and leave them az limpsey az
the nek ov a ded goslin.</p>

<p>The kondem phool iz the kauze ov most all trubble thare
iz in this world, he ain’t alwus malishus, but iz alwus a phool.</p>

<p>I divide the populashun ov the whole world into 2 heaps,
and out ov respect for the parable ov the virgins in the bible,
i call 5 ov them wize and 5 ov them foolish.</p>

<p>It is verry easy tew be a kondem phool, enny boddy kan
be one, and not suspekt it.</p>

<p>Thare iz a large invoice ov phools just now pressing upon
the market, but the market for them iz stiddy, the demand
alwus being phull up tew the supply.</p>

<p>I rekolekt ov onst saying, upon a memorabel ockashun,
(i dont rekolek the ockashun now,) God bless the phools, and
don’t let them run out, for if it want for them, the rest ov
the world would be bothered tew git a good living.</p>

<p>Among the list ov prominent phools, i take the liberty tew
introduce the following:</p>

<p>The “Profeshional Phool,” one who travels for a living.</p>

<p>The “Wag Phool,” one who is a phool on private ackount.</p>

<p>The “Bizzness Phool,” one who either Bulls or Bears
everything in the market.</p>

<p>The “Radikal Phool,” one who kant help it.</p>

<p>The “Conservatiff Phool,” one who kan help it, but wont.</p>

<p>The “Meek Phool,” one who sez he prefers kodphish bawls
to porterhous stakes, or even quales on toast.</p>

<p>The “Hipreshure Phool,” one who, like the hornet, alwus
keeps mad in advance, so az tew be reddy for the ockashun.</p>

<p>The “Silly Phool,” one who thinks the whole civilized
world iz in luv with him.</p>

<p>The “Wise Phool,” one who thinks he knoze all things,
and luvs everyboddy.</p>

<p>And four thousand, 3 hundred and 36 other distinkt kinds
ov phools, which i haint got the pashunce tew elucidate now.</p>

<h3 id="sec-142-4">THE PRECISE MAN.</h3>

<p>The “Precise Man,” sumtimes parts hiz hare in the middle,
And when he duz, he kounts the hairs on each side ov hiz hed,
<span id="pg_345" class="page_anchor">345 </span>
and splits sum, if it iz necessary, tew make the thing ded
even.</p>

<p>If he iz a marrid man, everything must be jist so—if he iz
a bachelor it must be more so.</p>

<p>He alwus sets a hen on 12 eggs, and haz a grate horror for
all odd numbers.</p>

<p>He gits up at jist sitch a time in the morning, and goes tew
bed at jist sitch a time at night, and would as soon think ov
taking a dose ov striknine for the hikcups az tew kut oph a
dogs tale when the moon waz in the laste quarter.</p>

<p>The precise man haz but phew branes, and they are az well
broke az a setter dog’s, for he seldum makes a false point.</p>

<p>He iz a bundle of fakts and figgers, and iz az handy in the
naberhood az a pair ov platform skales or a reddy rekoner.</p>

<p>He iz invariably an honest man, but often az mutch from
pride az from principle.</p>

<p>He luvs hiz children, if he haz any, and would rather hav
them perfekt in the multiplikashun table than in the Illiad ov
Homer.</p>

<p>Hiz wife iz soon broke tew akt and think az he duz, and
she iz known fur and near for the excellence ov her softe
sope.</p>

<p>The laste thing he alwus duz Saturday night iz tew grease
hiz boots, and the fust thing Sunday morning iz tew wind up
the old wodden klok in the kitchen.</p>

<p>He iz generally respekted during life, and after he iz ded
and gone hiz children keep his fame fresh by pointing out
with pride the korner whare his kane alwus stood and peg
whare his hat alwus hung.</p>

<h2 id="sec-143">INDIVIDUAL FOLKS.</h2>

<h3 id="sec-143-1">THE OBTUSE MAN.</h3>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> obtuse man iz sawed off square at both ends, and iron

<p>He finds out the hard spot in things by running aginst

them, and like the merino ram, shuts up both eyes when he
butts.</p>

<p>It iz az hard tew git an idee into him az it iz tew git a
wedge into a pepperidge log.</p>

<p>He alwus sez “<i>Yes</i>” to what he don’t understand, and iz
az hard tew argy out ov a conceit az a dog iz out ov a bone.</p>

<p>He often sets himself up for a wise man, and sumtimes a
wit, but i never knu one tew think he waz a bore.</p>

<p>He goes thru life hed fust, and when he cums tew die he iz
az well seasoned az a foot-ball.</p>

<p>If he waz a going tew liv hiz life over again, he tells yu,
he wouldn’t alter it, only he would eat more raw onions and
be a hard-shell baptist.</p>

<p>Every man remembers him az a man too stubborn tew be
very viscious, with a few ideas, sum ov which he inherited,
but most ov which he got by sleeping with hiz mouth wide
open.</p>

<h3 id="sec-143-2">THE POSATIFF MAN.</h3>

<p>The posatiff man bets hiz last dollar on a kard and looses,
and then tells yu he knew he shouldn’t win.</p>

<p>He alwus knows what will happen 3 weeks from now, and
if it don’t happen he knew that too.</p>

<p>If he falls down on the ice and breaks hiz leg it want an
accident, it waz sumthing that couldn’t help but happen.</p>

<p>He iz az certain ov everything az a mule iz anxious tew hit
what he kicks at.</p>

<p>Yu kant tell him ennything new, nor ennything old, he iz
more certain ov things than Webster’s unabridged dickshionary.</p>

<p>The less certain yu are the more posatiff he iz.</p>

<p>He never made but one blunder in hiz life and that turned
out at last tew be a good hit.</p>

<p>The posatiff man haz too little cunning tew be very malishus,
he iz generally happy, bekauze he iz posatiff ov it, and
tho he gits things wrong oftner than he duz right, people are
pleazed at hiz blunders bekauze he iz so much in earnest.</p>

<p>He mistakes sullenness for bravery, and bekauze he feels
savage, everyboddy else must feel humble.</p>

<p>Thare iz no grater coward in the world than the cross man,
nor none eazyer tew kure.</p>

<p>He iz eazyer tew kure than the stummuk ake, for one good
knok down will do so.</p>

<h3 id="sec-143-4">THE PASHUNT MAN.</h3>

<p>The pashunt man never sez “<i>dam it</i>,” however much he
may think so.</p>

<p>He iz so well-ballanced that it takes at least fifty pounds ov
musketeze tew turn hiz skales.</p>

<p>He kan’t tell yu what makes him so pashunt if yu ask him;
it may be nothing but numbness after all.</p>

<p>Pashunce iz like enny other virtew, its value konsists in its
power tew resist temptashun.</p>

<p>It ain’t but little trubble for a graven image tew be pashunt,
not even in fly time.</p>

<p>Real pashunce stands amung the virtews, like genius amung
the gifts; in fakt, pashunce, iz the genius ov virtew.</p>

<p>The best thing i kno ov, tew try a man’s pashunce on, iz a
kicking heifer, if he finds himself praying for the heifer
every time she kicks, he haz got pashunce on the heart, and
brain both.</p>

<h3 id="sec-143-5">THE FUNNY MAN.</h3>

<p>The funny man kan’t open hiz mouth without letting a
joke fly out, like ginger pop, when the kork iz pulled out.</p>

<span id="pg_348" class="page_anchor">348 </span>

<p>Thare iz no genuine wit in the simply funny man, hiz only
desire iz tew make yu laff, and real wit don’t stoop so low.</p>

<p>The funny man’s jokes are at best only jests, sumtimes he
reaches tew the dignity ov a poor pun, and hiz vanity then
absorbs all hiz humor.</p>

<p>It iz an awful thing tew be a funny man, it iz almost az
dredful az the counterfiting bizzness.</p>

<p>Thare iz no stattue aginst joking, but thare ought tew be,
not that I think a good joke iz criminal, but they are so scarce,
they are suspicious. I am the last man who wants tew see
enny real wit leave this world, for i think genuine wit, iz az
good az religion.</p>

<h3 id="sec-143-6">THE HONEST MAN.</h3>

<p>Honest men are skarse, and are a going tew be skarser.</p>

<p>Thare grate scarsity iz what makes them valuable.</p>

<p>If every boddy waz honest, the supply would ruin the demand.</p>

<p>Honesty iz like money, a man haz tew work hard tew git
it, and then work harder tew keep it.</p>

<p>Adam waz the fust honest man we hav enny ackount ov,
and hiz honesty want ov mutch ackount.</p>

<p>You couldn’t put yure finger on Adam, for in the garden
ov Eden, when he waz wanted, he couldn’t be found.</p>

<p>Old deakon Skinner, ov lower Pordunk village, waz an
honest man, he wouldn’t hunt for hen’s eggs on sunday, but
he waz an awful cluss man, he set a hen once, on three eggs,
just tew save eggs.</p>

<p>It don’t make
enny difference
which side ov him
yu cum up to, he iz
the same biggness

only way tew git at
him, enny how, is
tew face him.</p>

<p>He knows he iz
square, and never

trieing tew prove it.</p>

<p>The square man
iz one ov the best-shaped
men the
world haz ever produced,
he iz one of them kind ov chunks that yu kant alter
tew fit a spot, but yu must alter the spot tew fit him.</p>

<h3 id="sec-144-2">THE OBLONG MAN.</h3>

<p>The oblong man alwus meazzures more one way than he
duz the tuther, and yu have got tew meazzure him every
time yu want tew use him.</p>

<p>The shortest way ov him to-day may be the longest way
to-morrow.</p>

<p>He ain’t alwus a bad man by enny means, he iz often only
unfortunate, and he haz been heard frequently tew say, that
he iz sorry that he waz bilt so.</p>

<p>Sum ov the smartest men in kreashun are oblong, and will
fit most enny kind ov a spot with a very little altering.</p>

<h3 id="sec-144-3">THE PERPINDIKLAR MAN.</h3>

<p>The perpindiklar man iz half-brother tew the square man,
and iz az uprite az a lamp-post.</p>

<p>He iz a dredful good kind ov a man tew hav laying around
loose, and he haint got but one fault, or rather misfortin, and
that iz, he is so stiff he kant dodge good.</p>

<p>I don’t like tew see a man dodge everything, but thare are
things in this world that are cheaper tew dodge than tew buk
aginst.</p>

<p>I like the up and down, perpendiklar man, yu kan alwus
git at the solid kontents ov him, by just multiplying him by
himself.</p>

<h3 id="sec-144-4">THE LIMBER MAN.</h3>

<p>The limber man iz a kind ov injun rubber specimint ov
humanity, who kant tell himself how fur he kan stretch without
breaking.</p>

<p>He iz reddy tew stretch, or be stretched, and tho he flies
bak sumtimes tew the old spot, he quite az often snaps off in
such a bad place that he kant be mended agin.</p>

<p>Limber men aint alwus malishus, but they are az hard to
manage az a greased pig, take a holt ov them whare yu will,
yu find them pizon slippery.</p>

<p>Limber men are rather wuss than wicked ones, for they
kant even tell themselfs what they are going tew do next.</p>

<p>When a limber man douz git tew going wrong, he iz like
a blind mule, when he gits tew kicking, yu aint safe nowhare.</p>

<p>Limber men dont alwus lak kapacity, it would perhaps be
better if they did, for a still phool iz one ov the safest people
we hav.</p>

<h3 id="sec-144-5">THE JOLLY MAN.</h3>

<p>Jolly men are most alwus good men.</p>

<p>It iz dredful eazy tew mistake spasmodik hilarity for good
natur.</p>

<p>I have seen men who were called jolly good fellows who
were az treacherous in their joy az a kat iz.</p>

<span id="pg_351" class="page_anchor">351 </span>

<p>Yu will alwus notiss one thing, when a kat purrs the most,
she haz just thought ov sum new kind ov deviltry.</p>

<p>I kno ov no vice in genuine jollity.</p>

<p>When a man iz jolly all over, he iz too happy and kareless
tew be vicious.</p>

<p>I hav seen people who could laff long and loud, but thare
was no more good nature in it than thare iz grief in a hyena
when they imitate the wail of an infant.</p>

<p>’Tis true we kant alwuss tell about theze things, but if we
watch a man all summer, and hang around him all winter,
when spring cums agin we ought tew be able tew guess whether
the laff that iz in him iz the aroma ov hiz good natur, or iz
only the aroma ov the hikkups.</p>

<h3 id="sec-144-6">THE PEWTER MAN.</h3>

<p>The pewter man takes hiz name from the old-fashioned
pewter spoon, made out ov cheap material, impossible tew
keep bright long, eazy tew take impreshuns from almost enny
thing, and no more ring tew it than thare iz tew a bogus haff
dollar.</p>

<p>Puter men are mighty common here on earth, not only
kommon bekauze they are plenty, but kommon bekauze they
don’t amount tew mutch.</p>

<p>They ain’t exactly phools; if they was, we could deskribe
them better.</p>

<p>They are like bass wood punkin seeds, and white oak whetstuns,
in a well-stocked kuntry store, kind ov necessary, tew
keep up the assortment.</p>

<p>They never do enny thing verry good or verry bad, and go
thru life a good deal az a boy goes tew distrikt skool, in green-apple

<h3 id="sec-144-7">THE FITEING MAN.</h3>

<p>The fiteing man iz a kind ov human bull tarrier, with a jaw
on him like a wolf trap that haz just been sprung.</p>

<p>He haz a low, sour forehead, a beefy neck, a small eye, and
an ugly pug noze.</p>

<span id="pg_352" class="page_anchor">352 </span>

<p>Hiz intelligence konsists in knowing how tew maul another
human being, able tew take it in return, and not kno it.</p>

<p>All hiz ideas ov honor are governed bi the code which calls
it dishonorable to puntch a man belo the belt.</p>

<p>Hiz grate ambishun in life iz tew win a phew bloody fights,
and then end hiz daze az the proprietor ov a gin mill, with
hiz name and infamy hung up in gilt letters over hiz bar.</p>

<p>He iz a rank koward bi natur, and never fought a battle
yet in which he did not expekt hiz low cunning would enable
him tew outwit hiz adversary.</p>

<h3 id="sec-144-8">THE PRECISE MAN.</h3>

<p>The precise man weighs just 16 ounces tew the pounds,

<p>He iz more partiklar about being <i>just so</i>, then he iz about
being right.</p>

<p>Hiz blunders, if he ever makes enny, are all kronik, and
kant be kured.</p>

<p>He iz most alwus what we kall a virtewous man at heart,
but thare iz no logik kan make him alter hiz mind.</p>

<p>He iz az exact in hiz way az a kompass.</p>

<p>He knows the year, the month, the day ov the week, and
sumtimes the very hour that enny important event took
place.</p>

<p>He kan tell yu the exact age ov every old maid in the naborhood,
and kan rekollekt distinkly ov hearing hiz grate-grandfather
tell what sort ov a kloud it waz that the lightning cum
out ov that struck the steeple ov the Presbeterian church,
and knoked the weathercock on it into the shape ov a cocked
hat.</p>

<p>The precise man iz a mere bundle ov fakts, figures, and
trifling incidents, which are ov the utmost importance tew
him, but not ov mutch use tew ennyboddy else.</p>

<p>He iz just about az mutch consequentz whare he livs az a

<h2 id="sec-145">COQUETT AND PRUDE.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">M</span>enny</span> essays hav bin writ on the natur ov woman, setting
forth her aspirashuns, her genius, her impulses, the
delikate mechanicks ov her pashuns, the aroma ov her heart,
the soft leading strings ov her dispisishun, the cast iron fortitude
ov her resolves, and the lurid glare ov her love and her
hate.</p>

<p>I hav read menny ov these, only tew be more solid in mi
long cultivated opinyun, that woman and her character in the
lump, iz like the ranebo in the East, butiful beyond language,
full ov promis and impossible tew paint.</p>

<p>In mi philosophy, rude and untutored, i call woman the
lesser light, the moon, gentle as an angel, stealing softly along
the buzzum ov the skey on an errand ov love, light for the
hour ov darkness, pashunt watcher while the world sleeps,
queen ov the night, jeweled with stars.</p>

<p>I compare woman to a vine full ov tendrils, which can’t
reach perfection without a pole to climb, and then often mounting
far above the pole.</p>

<p>Man i call the sun, filling the earth with phrenzy, woman
the moon, that chastens the twilight, and steals through the
lattice to play on the hearth-stone.</p>

<p>Each one haz their sphear, and the loss ov either would be
the blotting out ov the sun, or the moon.</p>

<p>Each one haz their appointment, which should not be
changed.</p>

<p>When the moon gits between the earth and the sun, then
we alwus have an eclipse. I beleave that a kind Providence,
the arktekt ov men, monkeys and things, haz given me and
mi wife two paths to travell, side by side, and both ending at
the same goal.</p>

<p>Sum think that the lives ov the sexes are a mere competition,
that what one iz both may be, i shall beleave this when
the roze bush bears butternuts and the thistle sheds perfume.</p>

<p>Amung charakteristicks so butiful, it would be strange
if we shouldn’t find a variety, sum even that are unlovely,
<span id="pg_354" class="page_anchor">354 </span>
for perfeckshun don’t inhabit this world, not even in the disguize
ov a woman.</p>

<p>Thare is two patches in the paradise ov the female garden,
that is devoted to the culture of two funny, and very contrary
vegatables, one is lokated in the south east corner of the heart,
and the other at the northern, or frigid end.</p>

<div class="illustration full" id="ill-62">
<a href="images/ill-63.jpg"><img src="images/ill-63_min.jpg" alt=""></a>
<p class="caption">COQUETT AND PRUDE.</p>
</div>

<p>The southern crop is coquetry, and the northern one is
prudery.</p>

<p>Sumtimes these patches are cultivated more assidiously, to
the neglekt ov awl the rest, and form the staple crop of the
heart.</p>

<p>Coquetry is the cussidness ov an artful pashun, that feels
its oats just enuff to want to kick up all the time, and don’t
seem to care who gits hurt.</p>

<p>It lays in wait, in its butiful wrought net, like a spider for
its viktim, and seems to take more fun in ketching a fly, than
in keeping him.</p>

<span id="pg_355" class="page_anchor">355 </span>

<p>A coquett is a good deal like a rare bush, in the springtime
of life it is full of flowers, and in the fall, full of thorns.</p>

<p>Thare are sum blossoms that are fore-runners of fruit, but
the fragrant glory of a coquett is not of this breed.</p>

<p>This pashun iz like avarice, it eats up all the other good
ones, and spends its old age, racked with the horrors of an ill
digestion. Coquetts are generally long lived, faded emblems
of viktorys without honour, mournful az a cypruss, chanting
their own dirges.</p>

<p>Prudery iz nothing more than the tropikal fruits of the
hearts gardens raized at the north end ov it, prudes, and coquets,
are the extremes of the same pashuns, and the philosophers
tell us, that “extremes meet.” A prude skorns tew
make a conquest, not upon principle, but bekause she kant,
she hates a man with her love.</p>

<p>A prude iz nothing more than an ill looking coquet, give
the prude buty, and yer have got a coquet, and the bitterest
prudes the world ever saw, are the old, and battle worn coquets,
who are too decrepid to take the field.</p>

<p>Coquets, and prudes, ought tew be compelled to hunt in
couples, so that when the coquet haz wounded the game, the
prude kan nuss the dieing viktim.</p>

<p>But prudes and coquetts never agree; two ov a trade seldom
do. Both ov these pashuns are disgusting, and the old
age ov both iz bitterness.</p>

<p>Prudery iz the remorse ov cunning that haz been foiled;
and coquettry seems to be the abandon ov art and buty.</p>

<p>Prudes owe mutch ov their success to their inability to find
enny temptashuns, and coquetts are made more viscious by
flatterys.</p>

<p>But a true woman dont cultivate neither ov these patches
in her heart; the ever elegant perceptions ov her instincts
teaches her not to take up the sword ov the coquett, nor the
remorseless pruning-hook of the prude.</p>

<p>It seems to me, the more that I gaze at it, that a prude iz
nothing more than a coquett gone to seed.</p>

<p>I would rather be a coquett than a prude; thare iz some
<span id="pg_356" class="page_anchor">356 </span>
fun in it—thare is viktory in it; while prudery, at best, iz
only a defeat in an inglorious cauze.</p>

<p>Coquetts sumtimes git marrid, but they are az hard to tame
az a patridge, and aint worth enny more after they are tamed,
besides being a heap more jealous than a mother-in-law to
their daughters; while a prude, for a wife, iz but the bluest
kind ov a school-marm at home on a furlough.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would say, in all kindness, to the coquetts,
that they seldom hav but one fust-class man in their nets; all
that they bag afterward are of the same breed az themselves;
and to the prudes I would suggest that wimmin are growing
more plenty every year, and that thare are but few ov them,
who insist upon it, that will pay the wear and tear ov a
humiliating and laborious siege.</p>

<p>He is a tea-kup full of whipped sillybub—a kitten in pantylets—a

<p>He is a vine without enny tendrills—a fly drowned in sweet

<p>He lives as the butterflise do—noboddy kan tell whi. He
is as harmless as a cent’s wuth ov spruce gum, and as useless
as a shirt button without enny button-hole.</p>

<p>He is as lazy as a bread-pill, and has no more hope than a
last year’s grasshopper.</p>

<p>He is a man without enny gaul, and a woman without enny

<span id="pg_357" class="page_anchor">357 </span>

<p>Theze fellers don’t beleaf in spooks, and yet they are about
the only folks who ever see enny. A jealous man iz alwus
happy, jist in perposhun az he iz mizerable.</p>

<p>Jelosy iz a disseaze, and it iz a good deal like sea sickness—dreadful
sick and kan’t vomit.</p>

<h3 id="sec-146-3">THE ANONYMOUS MAN.</h3>

<p>The <i>Anonymous Man</i> boards at a red tavern, and pays
for hiz board bi tending bar occasionly. He hain’t got any

<p>He iz a loafer bi profession, without enny vices.</p>

<p>He rides on the box, once in a while, with the driver, and
noboddy thinks ov asking him for hiz stage fare.</p>

<p>He iz az useless az an extra pump would be in the desert

<p>He sprung from a respektable family; his great grandfather
woz a justiss ov the peace; but he has not got vanity
enuff tew brag on it.</p>

<p>He ain’t necessarily a phool, enny more than a bull’s eye

<h3 id="sec-146-4">THE STIFF MAN.</h3>

<p>The <i>Stiff Man</i> looks down, when he walks, upon folks.
He don’t seem tew hav but one limber jinte in him, and that

<p>He is a kind of maskuline turkey, on parade in a barn-yard.</p>

<p>He iz generally loaded with wisdum clear up tew the muzzell,
<span id="pg_358" class="page_anchor">358 </span>
and when he goes oph, makes a noize like a cannon, but
don’t dew enny dammage.</p>

<p>I hav seen him fire into a crowd, and miss evry man.</p>

<p>This kind ov <i>stiff man</i> iz verry handy tew flatter. They
seem tew know they ain’t entitled tu a good artikle, and,
tharefore, are satisfied with hard soap.</p>

<p>Thare ain’t but fu men who git stiff on what they acktually
know, but most aul ov them git stiff on what they acktually
feel.</p>

<p>Stiff men are called aristokrats, but this ain’t so. Thare
ain’t no such thing as aristokrats in this country.</p>

<p>The country ain’t long enuff yet, unless a man haz got sum
Indian in him.</p>

<p>Az a gen’ral thing, stiff men git mad dredful eazy, and
have tew git over it dredful eazy, bekauze folks ain’t apt tew
git a big skare at what they ain’t afraid ov.</p>

<p><i>Stiff man</i> had a grandfather once, who went tew Congress
from our distrikt, and thare ain’t one in the whole family that

<h3 id="sec-146-5">THE MODEL MAN.</h3>

<p>The <i>Model Man</i> never disturbs a hen when she iz setting;
never speaks cross tew a lost dogg; always puts a five cent
shinplaster in hiz vest pockett late Saturday night, tew hav
it ready Sunday morning for the church platter; rizes whenever
a lady enters the street kars; remembers your uncle
plainly, and asks after all the family. If he steps on a kat’s
tail, is sure to do it light, and immegiately asks her pardon;
reads the <span class="smallcaps">Phunny Phellow</span>, and laffs bekause he kan’t help
it; hooks up hiz wife’s dress, and plays hoss with the children.
Never meddles with the cream on the milk pans; goes
eazily of errands and cums back in seazon; attends everyboddy’s
phuneral; kan always tell when the moon changes;
thinks just az yu do, or the other way if you want him to;
follows evry boddy’s advice but hiz own; praktices most ov
the virtews without knowing it; leads the life ov a shorn
lamb; gits sick after a while, and dies az soon az he kan, tew
save making enny further trubble.</p>

<span id="pg_359" class="page_anchor">359 </span>

<p>The model man’s vices are not feared, nor hiz virtews respekted.
He lives in the memory of the world just about

<h2 id="sec-147">THE NEAT PERSON.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">N</span>eatness</span>, in my opinyun iz one ov the virtews, I hav
alwus konsidered it twin sister to chastity. But while
I almost worship neatness in folks, i hav seen them who did
understand the bizzness so well az tew acktually make it fearful
tew behold. I hav seen neatness that want satisfied in being
a common-sized virtew, but had bekum an ungovernable
pashun, enslaving its possesser, and making everyboddy uneazy
who kum in kontackt with it.</p>

<p>When a person finds it necessary to skour the nail heds in
the cellar stairs evry day, and skrub oph the ducks’ feet in
hot water, it iz then that neatness haz bekum the tyrant of
its viktim.</p>

<p>I hav seen individuals who wouldn’t let a tired fly light on
the wall paper ov their spare room enny quicker than they
would let a dog mix up the bread for them, and who would
hunt a single cockroach up stairs and down until his leggs
were wore oph clear up to his stummuk but what they would
hav him. I kan’t blame them for being a little lively with
the cockroach, for i don’t like cockroaches miself—espeshily
in mi soup.</p>

<p>Thare iz no persons in the world who work so hard and so
eternally az the vicktims ov extatick neatness; but they don’t
seem tew do mutch after all, for they don’t get a thing fairly
cleaned to their mind before the other end ov it gits dirty,
and they fall tew scrubbing it awl over agin.</p>

<p>If you should shut one ov these people up in a hogshead,
they would keep bizzy scouring all the time, and would clean
<span id="pg_360" class="page_anchor">360 </span>
a hole right thru the side ov the hogshed in less than 3
months.</p>

<p>They will keep a whole house dirty the year round cleaning

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">J</span>ohn</span> Bascomb iz now living in Coon Hollow, Raccoon
county, State ov Iowa.</p>

<p>He iz 196 years old, and kan read fine print by moonlite
33 feet oph.</p>

<p>He remembers Gen. Washington fust rate, and once lent
him 10 dollars teu buy a pair ov kaff skin boots with.</p>

<p>He fit in the revolushun, also in the war ov 1812, likewize
in the late melee, and sez he won’t take sass now from enny
man living.</p>

<p>He iz a hard shell baptiss by religion, and sez he will die
for hiz religion.</p>

<p>He waz konverted 150 years ago, and thinks the hard-shell
iz the tuffist religion thare iz for every day wear. He sez
that one hard shell baptiss ken do more hard work on the same
vittles during a hot day than 15 episkopalites.</p>

<p>He haz alwus used plug tobbako from a child, and sez he
lernt how teu cheu bi watching a cow cheu her cud.</p>

<p>He haz never drunk enny intoxicating licker but whiskey,
and sez that no other licker is helthy. He thinks 3 horns a
day iz enuff for helth.</p>

<span id="pg_362" class="page_anchor">362 </span>

<p>He haz alwus voted the dimokratik ticket for the last 170

vote for Jim Buchanan.</p>

<p>He haint never seen a rale-road yet, nor a wimmin’s rite
convenshun.</p>

<p>His gratest desire, he tells me, iz teu see Gen. Jackson, and
sez that he shall go next year down teu Tennesee teu see him.</p>

</div>

<p>He fatted a hog
last year, with hiz
own hands, that
weighed 636 pounds
after it waz drest and
well dried out. He
iz very cheerful, and
sez he won 7 dollars
on the weight ov this
hog, out ov one ov
the deakons ov the
hard-shell church.
He deklares this teu
be one ov the proudest
acksidents ov hiz
life, for the deakon
waz known far and
near az a tite kuss.</p>

<p>He tells me that
for 90 years he haz went teu bed at just 17 minnits after 9,
and haz arozen at precisely 5 o’clock the next day.</p>

<p>The fust thing he duz in the morning iz teu take a short
drink, about 2 inches, and then for an hour before brekfasst he
reads the allmanax. (<i>I will here state that it iz “Josh Billings’
Farmers’ Almanax” that he reads.</i>)</p>

<p>I asked him hiz opinyun ov gin and milk az a fertilizer.
He pronounsed it bogus, and sed that the good old hard-shell
drink, <i>whiskey unadorned</i>, waz the only speerits that never
went bak on a man.</p>

<p>Hiz habits are simple. For brekfast he generally et four
<span id="pg_363" class="page_anchor">363 </span>
slices ov psalt pork, 3 biled pertatoze, a couple ov sassagis, 5
hot bisskit, a dozen ov hard biled eggs, 2 kups ov rhye coffe,
a small plate ov slapjax, sum phew pickles, and cold cabbage
and vinegar, if thare waz enny left from yesterday’s dinner.</p>

<p>Hiz dinner waz alwus a lite one, and he seldum et ennything
but sum biled mutton, sum korned beef, sum kold ham,
and sum injun puddin tew top oph with.</p>

<p>Hiz suppers were mere nothing, and konsisted simply ov
kold psalt pork, kold korned beef, kold biled mutton, and,
once in a grate while, a phew slices ov kold ham, with mustard
and hoss reddish.</p>

<p>I examined hiz hed and found that he had all the usual
bumps in a remarkable state ov preservashun.</p>

<p>He haz a good ear for musik, and whisselled me Yankee
Doodle, with variashuns.</p>

<p>He waz born a shumaker, but hasn’t done ennything at the
trade for the last 125 years. He enjoys the best ov health,
but just now he iz teething, which he tells me iz hiz 7th sett.</p>

<p>He iz a firm beleaver in the Darwin theory, and sez he used
teu hear hiz grate-grandfather tell ov a race ov men sumwhare
down on the coast ov Florida, who had sum little ov the
kaudle appendix still remaining.</p>

<p>On the subjekt ov marriage hiz hed seems teu be ded level.
He sed “that he had been married 15 times, and proposed
again teu Hannah Campbell, a lady in the naberhood, who
waz 28 years old.”</p>

<p>I asked him what he thought his chances were for obtaining
the lady’s hand, and he sed “it lay between him and one
Theodorus Whitney, a travelling korn doctor,” and added “if
Whitney didn’t look out he would enlarge his head for him.”</p>

<p>Upon mi asking him what he attributed his immense life
and vigor to, he sed, in a klear and distinkt voice:</p>

<p>“To 3 small horns ov whiskey a day, beleaving in the hard
shell doktering, and voting unanimously the demokratik
ticket.”</p>

<p>I thankt him very mutch for the informashun he had given
me ov himself, and asked him if he had enny objekshun to
<span id="pg_364" class="page_anchor">364 </span>
mi putting it into print, and he manifested a great desire that
i should do so, not forgetting teu make special menshun ov
what he had sed about enlarging Whitney’s hed for him, for
he thought that would klear him out ov the naberhood.</p>

<p>I left John Bascomb after a deliteful visit ov four hours,
and thought over teu miself, if thare waz enny two rules for
long life that had been thus far diskovered that waz alike.</p>

<p>The more i thought ov this, the more i wished i could cum
akrost Methuseler for a feu minnitts, and hear him tell how
he managed.</p>

<h3 id="sec-148-2">ELIZIBETH MEACHEM.</h3>

<p>Lib Meachem (az she iz familiarly called in the township
whare she resides) iz one ov the rarest gems ov extenuated
mortality that has ever been mi blessed luk teu enkounter.</p>

<p>She iz not so old az Bascomb bi about two years, being only
about 194 years old. Next to Lot’s wife she iz the best preserved
woman the world kontains.</p>

<p>I reached her place ov residence early in the morning, and
in one minnit after i told her mi bizzness her tounge had a
phull hed ov steam on, and for 3 hours it run like a stream
ov quicksilver down an inklined plain.</p>

<p>I asked her a thousand questions at least, but not one ov
them did she answer, but kept talking all the time faster than
Pochahontas kan pace down hill teu saddle.</p>

<p>Az near az i could find out she had lived 194 years simply
bekauze she couldn’t die without cutting short one ov her
storys.</p>

<p>I asked her teu show me her tounge—I wanted to see if
that member waz badly worn; but she couldn’t stop it long
enuff teu sho it.</p>

<p>This woman haz reached her ernomus age without enny
partikular habit.</p>

<p>She haz outlived every boddy she haz kum akrost, so far,
by out-talking them.</p>

<p>The only subject that I could for a moment arrest the flood
ov her language with, waz the fashions; but this waz a subjekt
upon whitch i unfortunately wan’t mutch.</p>

<span id="pg_365" class="page_anchor">365 </span>

<p>As a last hope ov drawing her out upon sum fakts az teu
her mode ov life, i tutched upon that all-absorbing topick teu
both old and yung—i refer now teu matrimony.</p>

<p>Her fust husband it seemed, waz a carpenter, and, teu use
her own words, “waz too lazy teu talk, or teu listen while she
talked, and so he died.”</p>

<p>Her seckond husband waz a pretty good talker but a poor
listener, and, tharefore, he died.</p>

<p>Her third husband waz a deff and dum man, and, az she
remarked, “either he or she had got teu die, and the man
died.”</p>

<p>Her fourth husband undertook teu out-talk her, and died
early.</p>

<p>In this way she went on deskribing her husbands, 12 in all.</p>

<p>Az i roze teu depart i sed teu her sollemly:</p>

<p>“<span class="smallcaps">Elizabeth Meachem</span>, yu hav been mutch marrid, and
mutch an inkosolate widder—at what time ov life do yu think

<h2 id="sec-150">MY FUST GONG.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">I</span> never</span> kan eradicate holy from mi memry the sound ov
the first gong I ever herd—i was setting on the frunt
stupe ov a tavern in the sitty ov Bufferlo, pensively a smokin.</p>

<p>The sun was a goin tu bed, and the heavens fur and nere
was blushing at the purformanse.</p>

<p>The Eri kanall with its goldin waters was on its windin wa
tu albany, and i was perusin the line botes, a flotin by, and
thinkin ov Italy, (whare i used tu live,) and her gondolers,
and gallus wimmin.</p>

<p>Mi entire sole was, as it ware in a swet, i wanted tu climb,
i felt grate, i aktually grew.</p>

<p>Thar ar things in this life tu big tu be trifled with, thar ar
times when a man brakes luce from hisself, when he sees
speerits, when he kan almost tuch the moon, and feels as tho
he kud fill both hands with the stars ov heavin and almost
sware he was a bank president.</p>

<p>Thats what ailed me.</p>

<p>But the korse ov tru luv never did run smoove, (this iz
Shakesperes opinion too, i and he often think thru one quill)
just az i was doing my best, ... dummer, dummer,
spat, bang, beller, crash, roar, ram, dummer, dummer, whang,
rip, rare rally, dummer dummer, dummer dum, ...
with one tremenjis jump, i struck the senter ov the side walk,
with anuther i kleared the gutter and with anuther, i stud in
the middle ov the strets snorting like a injin poney, at a band
ov musik; i gazed in wilde dispare at the tavern stand, mi
harte swelled up as big as an out door oven, mi teeth were as
luce as a string ov prairy beads.</p>

<p>I thout all the crokery in the tavern stand had fell down,
i thout ov fenomenoms, i thought ov gabrel and his horn.</p>

<p>I was just on the pint ov thinking ov sumthing else when
the landlord cum out to the frunt stupe ov the tavern stand
holding by a string the bottom ov an old brass kittle.</p>

<p>He called me gentla with his hand i went slola and sadla tu
<span id="pg_370" class="page_anchor">370 </span>
him, he calmed mi feres, he ced it was a gong; i saw the cussed
thing, he ced supper was reddy, he axed me if i would hav
black or green tea and i ced i would.</p>

<h2 id="sec-151">KORN.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">K</span>orn</span> iz a serial, i am glad ov it.</p>

<p>It got its name from Series, a primitiff woman, and
in her day, the goddess ov oats, and sich like.</p>

<p>Korn iz sumtimes called <i>maize</i>, and it grows in sum parts
of the western country, very amaizenly.</p>

<p>I hav seen it out thare 18 foot hi (i don’t mean the aktual
korn itself, but the tree on which it grows.)</p>

<p>Korn haz ears, but never haz but one ear, which iz az deff
az an adder.</p>

<p>Injun meal iz made out ov korn, and korn dodgers iz made
out ov injun meal, and korn dodgers are the tuffest chunks,
ov the bread purswashun, known tew man.</p>

<p>Korn dodgers are made out ov water, with injun meal mixt
into it, and then baked on a hard board, in the presence ov a
hot fire.</p>

<p>When yu kant drive a 10 penny nail into them, with a
sledge hammer, they are sed, bi good judges, to be well done,
and are reddy tew be chawed upon.</p>

<p>They will keep 5 years, in a damp place, and not gro tender,
and a dog hit with one of them will yell for a week, and
then crawl under the barn, and mutter for two days more.</p>

<p>I hav knawed two hours miself on one side of a korn dodger
without produsing enny result, and i think i could starve
to death twice before i could seduce a korn dodger.</p>

<p>They git the name <i>dodger</i> from the immegiate necessity
ov dodgeing, if one iz hove horizontally at yu in anger.</p>

<p>It iz far better tew be smote bi a 3 year old steer, than a
korn dodger, that iz only three hours old.</p>

<span id="pg_371" class="page_anchor">371 </span>

<p>Korn was fust diskovered bi the injuns, but whare they
found it I don’t kno, and i don’t know as i care.</p>

<p>Whiskee, (noble whiskee,) is made out ov korn, and whiskee
is one ov the greatest blessings known tew man.</p>

<p>We never should hav bin able tew fill our state prizons
with energetick men, and our poor-houses with good eaters, if
it want for noble whiskee.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill-66">
<a href="images/ill-67.jpg"><img src="images/ill-67_min.jpg" alt="YOUNG MAN BE CAREFUL"></a>

<p>We never should have had enny temperance sons ov sosiety,
nor demokratik pollyticians, nor prize fites, nor good
murders, nor phatt
aldermen, nor whiskee
rings, nor nothing,
if it want for
blessed whiskee.</p>

<p>If it want for korn,
how could ennyboddy
git korned?</p>

<p>And if it want for
gitting korned, what
would life be worth?</p>

<p>We should all sink
down to the level ov
the brutes if it want
for gitting korned.</p>

<p>The brutes don’t
git korned, they
haint got enny
reason nor soul.</p>

<p>We often hear ov “<i>drunken brutes</i>,” this is a kompliment
to oxen which dont belong tew them.</p>

<p>Korn also haz kurnels, and kurnels are often korned, so are
brigadeer-ginerals.</p>

<p>Johnny kake is made out ov korn, so iz hasty puddin.</p>

<p>Hasty puddin and milk is quick tew eat.</p>

<p>All you hav got to do iz to gap, and swallo, and that iz the
last ov the puddin.</p>

<p>Korn waz familiar tew antiquity. Joseph waz sent down
<span id="pg_372" class="page_anchor">372 </span>
into Egipt after sum korn, but his brothers didn’t want him
to go, so they took pitty on him and pitted him in a pit.</p>

<p>When his brothers got back hum, and were asked whare
Joe waz, they didn’t acknowledge the korn, but lied sum.</p>

<p>It has been proved, that it iz wicked to lie about korn, or
enny ov the other vegetables.</p>

<p>Thare iz this difference between lieing, and sawing wood,
it iz easier to lie, espeshily in the shade.</p>

<p>Korn has got one thing that noboddy else has got, and that
iz a kob.</p>

<p>This kob runs thru the middle ov the korn, and iz as phull
ov korn as Job waz ov biles.</p>

<p>I alwus feel sorry when i think ov Job, and wonder how
he managed tew set down in a chair.</p>

<p>Knowing how tew set down, square on a bile, without
hurting the chair, iz one ov the lost arts.</p>

<p>Job waz a card, he had more pashunce, and biles, tew the
square inch, than iz usual.</p>

<p>One hundred and twenty-five akers ov korn tew the bushel
iz konsidered a good krop, but i have seen more.</p>

<p>I hav seen korn sold for 10 cents a bushel, and in sum
parts of the western country, it iz so much, that thare aint
no good law aginst stealing it.</p>

<p>In konklushun, if yu want tew git a sure crop ov korn,
and a good price for the krop, feed about 4 quarts ov it to a
shanghi rooster, then murder the rooster immejiately, and
sell him for 17 cents a pound, krop and all.</p>

<h2 id="sec-152">ADVERTIZEMENT.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">I</span> kan</span> sell for eighteen hundred and thirty-nine dollars,
a pallas, a sweet and pensive retirement, lokated on the
virgin banks ov the Hudson, kontaining 85 acres. The land
is luxuriously divided by the hand of natur and art, into pastor
and tillage, into plain and deklivity, into stern abruptness,
and the dallianse ov moss-tufted medder; streams ov sparkling
<span id="pg_373" class="page_anchor">373 </span>
gladness, (thick with trout,) danse through this wilderness
ov buty, tew the low musik ov the kricket and grasshopper.
The evergreen sighs az the evening zephir flits
through its shadowy buzzum, and the aspen trembles like
the luv-smitten harte ov a damsell. Fruits ov the tropicks,
in golden buty, melt on the bows, and the bees go heavy and
sweet from the fields to their garnering hives. The manshun
iz ov Parian marble, the porch iz a single diamond, set with
rubiz and the mother ov pearl; the floors are ov rosewood,
and the ceilings are more butiful than the starry vault of
heavin. Hot and cold water bubbles and squirts in evry
apartment, and nothing is wanting that a poet could pra for,
or art could portray. The stables are worthy of the steeds
ov Nimrod or the studs ov Akilles, and its henery waz bilt
expressly for the birds of paradice; while somber in the distance,
like the cave ov a hermit, glimpses are caught ov the
dorg-house. Here poets hav cum and warbled their laze—here
skulptors hav cut, here painters hav robbed the scene ov
dreamy landskapes, and here the philosopher diskovered the
stun, which made him the alkimist ov natur. Nex northward
ov this thing ov buty, sleeps the residense and domain
ov the Duke John Smith; while southward, and nearer the
spice-breathing tropicks, may be seen the barronial villy ov
Earl Brown, and the Duchess, Widder Betsy Stevens. Walls
ov primitiff rock, laid in Roman cement, bound the estate,
while upward and downward, the eye catches far away, the
magesta and slow grander ov the Hudson. As the young
morn hangs like a cutting ov silver from the blu brest ov the
ski, an angel may be seen each night dansing with golden
tiptoes on the green. (N. B. This angel goes with the
place.)</p>

how moral he iz) unless yu kan make munny on him.</p>

<p>2. Selekt 10 ov yure best looking and most talking members
tew meet the lekturer at the depot.</p>

<span id="pg_374" class="page_anchor">374 </span>

<p>3. Don’t fail tew tell the lekturer at least 14 times on yure
way from the depot tew the hotel that yu hav got the smartest
town in kreashun, and sevral men in it that are wuth over a
millyun.</p>

<p>4. When yu reach the hotel introduce the lekturer immejiately
to at least 25 ov yure fust klass citizens, if yu hav tew
send out for them.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill-67">
<a href="images/ill-68.jpg"><img src="images/ill-68_min.jpg" alt=""></a>
</div>

<p>5. When the lekturer’s room iz reddy go with him in
masse to hiz room and remind him 4 or 5 more times that yu
had over 3 thousand
people in yure city
at the last censuss,
and are a talking
about having an opera
house.</p>

<p>6. Don’t leave the
lekturer alone in his
room over 15 minnits
at once; he
might take a drink
out ov his flask on
the sli if yu did.</p>

<p>7. When yu introjuce
the lekturer
tew the aujience
don’t fail tew make
a speech ten or
twelve feet long, occupying
a haff an
hour, and if yu kan ring in sumthing about the growth ov
yure butiful sitty, so mutch the better.</p>

<p>8. Always seat 9 or 10 ov the kommitty on the stage, and
then if it iz a kommik lektur, and the kommitty don’t laff a
good deal, the aujence will konklude that the lektur iz a failure;
and if they do laff a good deal, the aujence will konklude
they are stool-pigeons.</p>

<p>9. Jist az soon az the lectur iz thru bring 75 or 80 ov the
<span id="pg_375" class="page_anchor">375 </span>
richest ov yure populashun up onto the stage and let them
squeeze the hand and exchange talk with the lekturer.</p>

<p>10. Go with the lekturer from the hall tew hiz room in a
bunch, and remind him once or twice more on the way that
yure sitty iz a growing very rapidly, and ask him if he don’t
think so.</p>

<p>11. If the lekturer should inquire how the comik lekturers
had succeeded who had preceded him, don’t forget tew tell
him that they were all failures. This will enable him tew
guess what they will say about him just az soon az he gits
out ov town.</p>

<p>12. If the lekturer’s fee should be a hundred dollars or more,
don’t hesitate tew pay him next morning, about 5 minnits
before the train leaves, in old, lop-eared one-dollar bills, with
a liberal sandwitching ov tobbakko-stained shinplasters.</p>

<p>13. I forgot tew say that the fust thing yu should tell a
lekturer, after yu had sufficiently informed him ov the immense
growth ov yure citty, iz that yure people are not edukated
up tew lekturs yet, but are grate on nigger-minstrels.</p>

<p>14. If it iz konvenient, i would alwus hav a boy or two
selling peanuts amung the aujience, during the lekture, at 5
cents a kupfull.</p>

<p>15. Never fail tew ask the lekturer whare he finds the most
appreshiated aujiences, and he won’t fail tew tell yu (if he iz
an honest man) that thare ain’t no state in the Union that
begins tew kompare with yures.</p>

<p>16. Let 15 or 20 ov yure kommitty go with the lekturer,
next morning, tew the kars, and az each one shakes hands
with him with a kind ov deth grip, don’t forget tew state that
yure citty iz growing very mutch in people.</p>

<p>17. If the night iz wet, and the inkum ov the house won’t
pay expenses, don’t hesitate tew make it pay by taking a
chunk out ov the lekturer’s fee. The lekturers all like this,
but they are too modest, as a klass, tew say so.</p>

<p>18. I know ov several other good rules tew follow, but
the abuv will do tew begin with.</p>

<h4>SUPPLEMENTARY.</h4>

<p>Everyboddy now-daze wants tew be a genius, but what the
world wants the most iz men ov tallent. It don’t require
enny genius tew shut a door after yu, when yu go thru it.</p>

<p>Rum iz a bill ov exchange on sum stait prizon or alms-hous.
I think i am right when i say that all things which do not
corrupt are innosent.</p>

<p>It iz not a bad kompliment tew poor human natur that vice,
tew be very seduktive, must be made attraktive. Thare are
but phew who prefer their iniquity on the haff shell.</p>

<p>It iz the surprizes ov life after all that giv it its zest—even
a rat bekums interesting bi the natral suddenty with whitch he
cums out or goes into his hoel.</p>

<p>I don’t bet on prekoshus children, they are like peas in Febuary,
either forced, or out ov their latitude.</p>

<p>Wit, without wisdum, iz like a song without sense, it don’t
pleaze long.</p>

<p>Yu kan’t find <i>contentment</i> laid down on the map: it iz an
imaginary place not settled yet; and thoze reach it the soonest
who throw away their compass and go it blind.</p>

<p>The gratest problem ever given tew man tew solve, and the
one whitch he haz made the least progress in, iz, “<i>know thyself</i>.”</p>

<p>This klub never gives a man up untill he kant tell the truth

<p>A <i>temperate liar</i> is the very wust kind.</p>

could tell a grate deal

<p>To be proof agin

hav no vanity, and
such a man never existed;
if he did, he
iz now one ov the
lost arts.</p>

<p>Hope haz made a

but thare iz one
thing about her that
i alwus did like—she
means well.</p>

<p>Sum people are
good simply bekauze they are too lazy tew be wicked, and
others, bekauze they hant got a good chance.</p>

<p>Thare iz one thing that i am not only certain, but proud
ov—thare iz more people in this world who hav changed from
bad to good, than from good to bad.</p>

<p>In munny, interest phollows the principal; in morals, principle
often phollows the interest.</p>

<span id="pg_385" class="page_anchor">385 </span>

<p>Yu will notis one thing—the devil seldum offers tew go into
partnership with a bizzy man, but yu will often see him offer
tew jine the lazy man, and furnish all the kapital.</p>

<p>Curiosity had twins—one waz <i>Invenshun</i> and the other
waz <i>Stick Yure Noze Into Things</i>.</p>

<p>Love iz about the only pashun ov the heart, that i kan
think ov now, that never makes enny mistakes that she kan
be held accountable for. If you waz a going tew try pure
love for a crime, what court would yu take her before?</p>

<p>I look upon the North Pole az one ov them spots, if taint
never found, we shant be none ov the wuss off, and, if it iz
found, we shant be none ov the better off.</p>

<p>I dont kno, after all, but it iz jist about az well tew git abuv
yure bizzness as it iz tew hav yure bizzness git abuv yu.</p>

<p>“In time ov peace prepare for war.” This iz the way sum
familys liv all the time.</p>

<p>Whenever yu hear a man who alwus wants tew “bet hiz

size ov hiz pile.</p>

<p>The devil iz the only individual on reckord who iz sed not
tew possess a single virtew.</p>

<p>Thare iz nothing that a man will git so sik ov az too mutch
mollassis.</p>

<p>The vices which a man kontrakts in hiz youth, however
mutch he may shake them oph, will often call on him thru
life, and seek tew renew hiz acquaintance.</p>

<p>Prudery iz often like the chesnutt burr. It seems az tho
it never would open, but by and by it duz, and lets the fruit
drop out.</p>

<p>Every man haz hiz phollys, but thare iz this difference—in
the poor man, they look like crimes, while, in the ritch
man, they only appear tew be exsentricitys.</p>

<p>Old age inkreases us in wisdom, and also in rumatism.</p>

<p>I kno lots ov pholks who are pius jist bekauze they waz
born so. They kant tell when they got religion, and, if they
should looze it, they wouldn’t kno it.</p>

<p>We never outgro our phollys—we only alter them.</p>

<span id="pg_386" class="page_anchor">386 </span>

<p>Thare iz this difference between charity and a gift—charity
cums from the heart; a gift, from the pocket.</p>

<p>Coquets are generally too silly to be very wicked.</p>

<p>Thare iz full az menny pholks in this world who hav bin
ruined bi kindness az thare iz who hav bin injured bi kruelty.</p>

<p>When fortune pipes, we must dance. It aint alwus that
she iz in tune.</p>

<p>I think the honesty ov men iz oftner the effekt ov policy
than principle.</p>

<p>Thare iz only one kind ov folks who kan keep a sekret
good, and they never take enny tew keep.</p>

<p>The man who iz wicked enuff tew be dreaded iz a safer
man in community than the one who iz just virtewous enuff
not to be suspekted.</p>

<p>Flattery iz the wust kind of lieing.</p>

<p>Hypockrasy iz alwus humble.</p>

<p>Gravity don’t prove enny thing. If a man iz really wise,
he dont need it, and, if he aint wize, he shouldn’t hav it.</p>

<p>It iz jist az natral tew be born poor az it iz tew be born
naked, and it iz no more disgrace.</p>

<p>Thare iz no excuse whatever for the insolence ov wealth;
thare may possibly be for the insolence ov poverty.</p>

<p>Dont forget one thing, mi boy—that when five men kall
yu a suckcess, and one man kalls yu a failure, that the one
man’s testimony iz what fetches the jury.</p>

<p>Lazyness iz the fust law ov natur; self-prezervashun iz the
seckond.</p>

<p>Yu kant konvert sinners bi preaching the gospel tew them
at haff price. Enny sinner who iz anxious tew git hiz religion

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">A</span>fter</span> a series ov unsuckcessfull wanderings thru life, i
find miself this day, December 28th, 1868, leaning on
the left arm ov mi lovely wife, a spektator ov this wondrous
<span id="pg_387" class="page_anchor">387 </span>
jugular vein, which pours the throbbing blood ov Lake Erie
into the vitals ov Lake Ontario.</p>

<p>I reached here at ten minutes past twelve, from the far
West, and found the place poor with visitors, it being the
center ov winter, and a cold time for money.</p>

<p>For the fust two hours i hung onto mi wife’s arm az still
az tho I had growed thare, and couldn’t see ennything on
account ov the clamor the water made; but gradually i begin
tew take notes ov things, and broke out, at last, in one ov
thoze posthumous remarks incidental tew the Billings family,
and which i deem tew abstruse tew be written down here.
My wife turned pale at the remark, and began tew fuss for
her kamphor.</p>

<p>The grandur, the almoste sublimity ov Niagara Falls has
been deskribed so often and so intolerably well by previous
visitors who hav been blest with a college edukashun, that it
would be but petty larceny for me tew git ketched at it; but
i will say, az the mad liquor impetuous tumbles hed fust into
the boiling kaldron belo, and the smoke ov its torrent ascends
amid the roar, i thought how idle language waz, and how
lazy deskription was, tew portray this great idea ov the
Almighty.</p>

<p>The fust thing i did waz tew git at the hight ov the Falls,
which, i found out, waz owing tew the distance the water fell,
the quantity ov the fluid, and the noise it made.</p>

<p>I have lost the paper i made the calculashun on, but it must
have been at least three thousand square feet.</p>

<p>I should think that the fuss the water makes, in its hurry
to fall, could be heard two hundred miles; but i didn’t hav
time tew stand off that distance and see if it waz acktually so.</p>

<p>I learned that the Falls belong now tew the United States
and Great Brittain, about half-and-half; but i shouldn’t wonder
if, sum time, the United States would own the whole
ov it.</p>

<p>Natur haz done the fair thing for Niagara, and man haz
not been lazy.</p>

<p>Thare waz one thing that happened tew me, while here,
<span id="pg_388" class="page_anchor">388 </span>
that will last me for mi lifetime, and when i git through with
it will do to hand down tew mi posteritys without the danger
ov spiling.</p>

<p>The Americans had just finished a new suspension bridge,
and hooked it onto the Canada side, just belo the Falls.</p>

<p>This bridge iz thirteen hundred feet in length, only twelve
feet wide, and about two hundred and fifty feet above the
water, and iz four hundred feet longer than the rail-road
bridge, three miles below.</p>

<p>Thare had but one carriage yet crossed this bridge, and it
being known that I waz connekted with the New York Weekly,
every boddy waz anxious that I should go over.</p>

<p>I took a seat, in an elegant turnout, got up for the occasion,
my wife by mi side, and driven by Darby Sherman, a noted
whip and ribbon handler ov the place, we started slowly
over.</p>

<p>We were the second pair ov mortals who had taken the
dizzy ride.</p>

<p>My wife grew dearer, and a good deal nearer tew me, az
we progressed, and before we reached the Canada side, we
were fairly one flesh.</p>

<p>When we had seen her magisty’s soil, and safely recrost
the flimsy span again, i am willing tew say i had suffered all
the suspension bridge glory that i wanted.</p>

<p>We were welcomed on our return tew the hotel, with open
arms, and two hot lemonades, with a little old rye lurking in
one ov them.</p>

<p>I took mine without enny wry face, and whispered tew my
soul, as the last swallow went reluctently down end ways,
“suspension bridges may be a good risk tew take, but a hot
lemonade whiskee iz better.”</p>

<p>Thare iz one thing that Niagara don’t lack, whatever may
be her moral defaults in other matters, and that iz <i>professional
guides</i>.</p>

<p>Upwards ov fifty different people waz anxious to guide me
tew the strong points ov the place.</p>

<p>One pale faced youth, more clamorous than the rest, with
<span id="pg_389" class="page_anchor">389 </span>
pattent leather boots, which had been new at the hight of
the last summer seazon, but which had bekum seazon cracked
and bulged severely at the roots ov each bigg toe, wanted tew
guide me so mutch that i finally told him he might guide me
sum if he would be keerful.</p>

<p>During the time this innocent youth waz in mi company
he told me more than 275 original and deeply interesting
lies.</p>

<p>He showed me whare Jim Buchanan killed the grate injun
warrier, Tecumser, in a hand to-hand scuffle, which lasted
three hours and seven minnits, during which time hiz own
grand father held the watch, and he pointed out the tree that
Major Andree waz hung on, and showed me the identical
house in the distance whare Robert Burnes wrote the immortal
ode tew hiz Highland Mary, and also the private residence,
(and banking house) ov the Hon. John Morrisey, and probably
would have shown me the Plymouth rock, whare our fore-fathers
landed, if I had asked him to do it.</p>

<p>But when i told him that John Morrisey had been dead
more than fifteen years, he diskovered that i wan’t so green.</p>

<p>He also offered tew sell me, for two dollars and fifty cents,
a lock of auburn hair, from the young lady’s head who past,
last spring, in high water, safely over the falls, seated on the
round side ov a hemlock slab, playing “A life on the ocean
wave” on a base vial.</p>

<p>After the young man had guided me for one hour and a
quarter, i paid him ten cents and dismisst him.</p>

<p>He looked at me, and then at the size ov the money, az
tho he thought we possibly might be twins.</p>

<p>I told him that thare waz one thing that the Billings family
waz a leetle partickular about, and that waz, in making the
right change to a ded beat.</p>

<p>Niagara is also fraught with most ov the rare curiositys
thare iz now on the face ov the earth, every boddy haz got
some miracle tew sell for two dollars and fifty cents.</p>

<p>Yu kan git charms for a watch kee whitled out ov a rock
that weighed sixty ton, and which fell four thousand feet, on
<span id="pg_390" class="page_anchor">390 </span>
the thirteenth ov last June, from table rock and waz picked
up by a little boy at the water’s edge, who waz fishing for
pickled crabs.</p>

<p>It iz but a step, i hav been informed, from the sublime tew
the ridikilus, and menny ov the residents at Niagara are familiar
with the step.</p>

<p>I kant think ov enny thing more intrinsically burlesque
than tew be standing in the presence ov one ov the most
imposing revelations of Nature on this footstool, and while
rapt in fear and admirashun, and chastened az it were by the
God ov Nature, tew hav a peddling imp ov humanity sacrilegisly
disturb yure adorashun by thrusting in yure face a paltry
piece ov petrified deadbeatery, and with all the nonchalence
and impudence ov a cold buckwheat slapjack ask yu two dollars
and fifty cents for what iz wuss than offal.</p>

<p>In olden times the brokers and dove pedlars were hustled
out ov the temple ov God, and it would be medicine tew me
to see this great temple, made without hands, cleaned ov the
two dollar and fifty cent vermin that infest it.</p>

<h2 id="sec-162">THE DANDY AND THE THIMBLE-RIGGER.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">A</span>fter</span> natur had finished the fust man and the fust woman,
she had a little material left at the bottom ov her cups,
and not willing tew waste ennything, she mixt the two remnants
together, more for a frolick than ennything else, just
to see what the compound would produce.</p>

<span id="pg_394" class="page_anchor">394 </span>

<p>Throwing the mixture onto the dieing coals, in a few minnitts
a half-baked, comikal creature lay smirking, and mincing,
before her.</p>

<p>This iz the way that the fust dandy waz made, and, with a
boquet in one hand and a looking-glass in the other, Dame
Nature turned him loose into the world, to root.</p>

<p>The construckshun ov this creature of remnants iz peculiar.</p>

<p>A dissection ov a dandy, in the thirteenth century, revealed
the fakt that hiz heart resembled a pin cushion, having no
cells, the interior ov it being filled with cotton batting and sawdust,
and stuck awl over the outside with rosettes, and dead
butterflys, with pins through them.</p>

<p>Hiz head waz divided into innumerable little stalls, in each
ov which waz deposited, in solution, a very small quantity ov
brains, which ackted independent ov each other.</p>

<p>One stall waz devoted to kid gloves az a science, another to
tight boots, and a third to colone water.</p>

<p>All hiz thoughts and affeckshuns are divided between the
fit ov hiz clothes and the admirashun ov them.</p>

<p>Hiz ideas never grasp ennything stronger than Phalon’s
last sensashun in perfumery; his whole emotional natur finds
its nourishment and counterpart in a plate ov the last Paris
fashions, hung up in a taylor’s window.</p>

<p>The genuine dandy—one who knows hiz bizzness—never
falls in love with ennything but hiz looking-glass; hiz strongest
pashun iz admirashun; he kant reach the dignity ov love.</p>

<p>To love, requires both brains and a soul; and a dandy in
love would be az whimsikal a sight az a butterfly kneeling at
the feet ov a tulip.</p>

<p>Your real dandy iz a long-lived bird; hiz pashions are
weak, but regular, and like a watch, the works and the case
wear out together.</p>

<p>He grows old like a boquet, and is brisk, and in humor to
the last.</p>

<p>Dandys hav no courage; their pashuns are a mixtur ov
weak and delikate things; they kant insult, nor be insulted;
they are rabbits among men, and among wimmin, not bold
enuff tew be feared, nor useless enuff to be dispized.</p>

<span id="pg_395" class="page_anchor">395 </span>

<p>Thare iz not one single trait in their charakter, that I kan
think ov now, highly commendible; they are selfish (and have
a right to be), bekauze they haint got ennything to spare;
their ambishun haz no more glory in it than a scent bag.</p>

<p>Reverence implys faith, and a dandy haz no faith, but in
the taste ov hiz hairdresser, or taylor; meekness implys hope,
but hope in them, iz nothing but emasculated impudence.</p>

<p>But while theze useless creatures lack the virtews ov life,
they are seldum, or never, gilty ov enny fust class vices, they
go through life heedless ov awl that iz very good, or very
bad, and when they git reddy to die, it iz ov az little importance
tew the world, az the loss ov a cosmetick receipt, or a
clever twist in a yeller neck-tie.</p>

<p>Your genuine dandy seldum unites, he courts, az the humming
burd duz among the flowers, for honey, not a wife, and
thinks that hiz attacks are awl conquests, but no sensible woman
would marry him, enny quicker, than she would knowingly
take counterfit money in change.</p>

<p>This world will never be rid ov the dandy, there iz so many
pincushion hearts, and heads not made for brains, thare iz so
much vanity that iz amply pleazed with a dog’s head on a
bamboo cane, thare iz so mutch kindness in looking glasses,
thare is so mutch fragrance in the extrackts ov Lubin, thare
iz sich a glory in being a pin feather king, for an evening,
among silly hearts, that young dandys will keep being born,
and old dandys will frisk, in spite of their gout, or enny bodys
philosophy.</p>

<p>Thimblerig iz a game az old az Methuselah.</p>

<p>It is played on the knees ov a young, and hawk-eyed, and
very polished gentleman, with a shiny black hat on hiz head,
encircled with a band ov crape, az a mourning badge, for hiz
late lamented father—or, “<i>enny other man</i>.”</p>

<p>The young gentleman wears a flame-colored necktie, striped
with orange, and held with a gilt slide, and a californy cluster
on hiz finger, az copious, az a gill ov beans. The game iz
conducted with three thimbles, a pellet ov fur, or wool, az
big az a grape seed, and iz sed tew be under one ov the thimbles,
<span id="pg_396" class="page_anchor">396 </span>
but after yu bet, and the thimble iz raized, it dont seem
to be invariably thar.</p>

<p>This pellet iz humorsly called the “little joker,” and iz
carlessly shown to you, az it appears to slide under cover ov
one ov the thimbles, but in fakt, slips under the cultivated
finger nail ov the gentlemanly rigger.</p>

<p>This iz only one ov the thousand modes ov gambling, but
probably the most niggerlike ov enny ov them.</p>

<p>If I had a son who was a thimblerigger by perswashun,
and could not be converted from the low, and villainous game
enny other way, I would pray tew hav him hit hard with
lightning, and then go into suitable mourning afterwards.</p>

<p>Gambling iz a vice, az natural to man, az the love ov gain,
it iz the pashun ov the civilized, and uncivilized, the Hindoo,
and the Saxon, the nigger, and the congressman.</p>

<p>It iz az old az history, and as demoralizing az enny profligasy,
that haz yet bin invented.</p>

<p>Rum and dice, are the two grate levellers, they bring the
judge down tew the grade ov the loafer, and pluck out by the
roots the tail feathers ov aristocracy.</p>

<p>They corrupt the warmest heart, chill the most ardent
ambishun, wither the brightest hopes, and brutalize the tenderest
pashions.</p>

<p>All that gamble may not reach the lowest depths ov its
degradashun, but they are on the right road.</p>

<p>Total abstinence iz the only cure for gambling, alteratives
wont answer.</p>

<p>One ov the wust feeters ov this disseaze iz, that it iz like the
small pox, if the patient recovers hiz health, he kant never
git rid ov the skars; a man may ceaze to be a gambler, but
once a gambler, the cursed pashion whines around him, like
a ghost around the buried.</p>

<h2 id="sec-163">LONG BRANCH IN SLICES.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">L</span>ong</span> Branch iz the eastern terminus ov sum real estate
on the west side ov the Atlantik Oshun, and iz lokated
cluss down to the edge ov the water.</p>

<span id="pg_397" class="page_anchor">397 </span>

<p>The populashun iz homo genus, woman genus, girl and boy
genus, yung one genus, and divers other kind ov genus.</p>

<p>The divers genus are sum plenty. They go into the Atlantik
Oshun, hand in hand, man and wife, phellow and gall,
stranger and strangeresses, drest in flowing robes, and cum
out by-and-by like statuary in a tite fit.</p>

<p>The Atlantik Oshun iz a grate success. The author and
proprietor ov it never makes enny blunders.</p>

<p>Thare iz a grate deal ov morality here at Long Branch.
Thare iz sum isolated cases ov iniquity, and a clever sprinkling
of innocent deviltry.</p>

<div class="illustration full" id="ill-72">
<a href="images/ill-73.jpg"><img src="images/ill-73_min.jpg" alt=""></a>
<p class="caption">JOSH BILLINGS BATHING AT LONG BRANCH.</p>
</div>

<p>I am pleased to state that the <i>iniquity</i> iz principally in fust
hands, and finds but few takers.</p>

<p>The fluid ov the Atlantik Oshun iz psalt, and haz bin so for
more than three hundred years to my knowledge. I state
this as a stubborn fakt, and the “<i>oldest inhabitant</i>” may help
himself if he can.</p>

<p>The ockashun ov this psaltness has bothered the clergy for
<span id="pg_398" class="page_anchor">398 </span>
years. Sum ov them say that large lumps ov psalt waz deposited
in the oshun, at an early day, bi the injuns, for safe
keeping, and sum say that the grate number ov kodfish and
number 2 makrel that travel in its waters haz flavoured the
oshun.</p>

<p>I endorse the kodfish and makrel job, not bekauze i think
it iz true, but bekauze i think it iz the weakest, and i hav
alwus bin in the habit ov standing up for the weak and oppressed.</p>

<p>Flirtashuns are thick here, but principally occur amung
thoze who hav wore the conjugal yoke until their necks hav
begun to git galled.</p>

<p>Theze flirtashuns are looked upon az entirely innocent, and
are called “<i>recruiting</i>.”</p>

<p>They are konsidered by sum (who call themselves good
judges) more <i>braceing</i> than the sea-airing.</p>

<p>Millionaires are numerous, besides others who put on a
millyun ov airs more or less.</p>

<p>Now and then yu will see a forrin snob just over from the
other side ov the Atlantik Oshun. They wear long shirt-collars,
turned down, and short nozes turned up.</p>

<p>The landlord tells me, they hav all paid their bills thus far,
and he sez, the last thing he duz at nite, before he goes tew
sleep, iz tew pray—they will kontinue on to do so.</p>

<p>The prayers ov the righteous are sed tew be heavy, and
weigh well, and the landlord being ov a righteous turn ov
mind, i think he will win.</p>

<p>The Continental Hotel iz the principal one here, and iz infested,
just now, by eight hundred and fifty innocent creatures,
who eat 3 meals per day.</p>

<p>The femail portion ov these dear innocent creatures, rool up
their sleeves, and go down once a day, to the keel ov their
trunk, and drag out bi the nap ov the nek sum clothes, that
would make the Queen ov Sheeba sorry that she hadn’t postponed
living untill Long Branch had bin invented, so that
she could hav got the style.</p>

<p>I advice all ov mi friends to come to the Continental Hotel,
and bring their best clothes with them.</p>

<span id="pg_399" class="page_anchor">399 </span>

<p>Long Branch haz menny things to interest the schollar, and
the philanthropist, among which iz the race course, just bilt.</p>

<p>I attended this race-course lately, and saw sum very good
rotary movements on it.</p>

<p>I didn’t bet, bekaze i hav alwus been principled aginst loseing
enny money.</p>

<p>I think i could win enny quantity ov money, and not spile
mi morality, but the loss ov a fu dollars, would git mi virtew
out ov repair for ages.</p>

<p>Long Branch iz also the home ov the miscelaneous crab,
and the world-renowned musketo.</p>

<p>The crab iz kaught in endless confusion at <i>Plezzure Bay</i>,
cluss bi Long Branch.</p>

<p>He iz kaught bi tieing a hard knot on the other end ov a
string, and then dropping the string down in the water, and
tickling the bottom ov hiz feet with the knot, in this way,
sumtimes he iz kaught, and sumtimes he iz knot.</p>

<p>The musketo iz az natral to Nu Jersee az Jersee litening iz.</p>

<p>The musketo iz a marvelous kuss, but whi he ever waz
allowed tew take out hiz papers, and travel, iz unknown to
me, or enny ov mi near relashuns.</p>

<p>If he haz enny destiny tew fill, it must be his stummuk,
for he iz the biggest bore, ackording tew the size ov hiz gimblet,
i hav ever met seldom. It dont look well for a philosopher
tew be fracktious at enny thing, not even a bugg, but if
enny boddy ever hears me swear (out loud) he may know thare
haz bin a kussid musketeer on mi premises.</p>

<p>I cum tew Long Branch (in company with mi wife) at the
opening ov the season, and put up at the Continental Hotel,
and intend now to keep putting up thare, untill the house
shuts up, if i hav tew klimb the flag-staff to do it.</p>

<p>Every boddy who puts up at this hotel, iz allowed tew put
up regular, once a week, for hiz board, and promiskuss things.</p>

<p>Thare iz a blessed privilege, which sum folks kant never
enjoy, untill they are deprived ov it.</p>

<p>It will then be forever too late.</p>

<p>I am one ov them cunning kritters, who, when they find
<span id="pg_400" class="page_anchor">400 </span>
a good hotel, a 225 pound landlord, and polite officials, dwell
with them heavily.</p>

<p>I hav sed before (in writing about hotels) that almost enny
boddy thinks they know how tew keep a hotel (<i>and they do
know how</i>) but this ackounts for the grate number ov kussid
poor hotels, all over the country.</p>

<h2 id="sec-164">BILLIARDS.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">E</span>veryboddy</span> seems tew be gitting crazy over a new
game, which haz jist bin diskovered, called billyards.</p>

<p>It iz played on the top ov a tabel which iz a little longer
than it iz square, and the game seems tew konsist in pushing
sum round red bawls agin sum round white bawls, until they
drop into sum little pudding bags which are hung unto the
outside ov the tabel.</p>

<p>It takes 2 men tew play the game, but 4 or 5 can look on.</p>

<p>They take oph their coats, and stand clus up to the tabel,
with a short piece ov a fishpole in their hands, which has a
chalk mark onto the end ov it.</p>

<p>Then one begins, by giving one ov the bawls a punch in
the belly, which sends it agin the next one’s belly, and so on,
till the other fellows turn fur punching comes on.</p>

<p>But yu ought tew see the game; it kant be delineated bi
words.</p>

<p>One feller generally beats the other feller, and then he
pays the landlord ov the consarn 25 cents fur the privilege ov
gitting beat, and buys sum gin, with lemonade in it, and aul
hands drink.</p>

<p>Then 2 more takes holt ov the fishpoles, and they punch
fur a spell, and so it goes on till 2 o’clock in the morning;
then each goes hum, having enjoyed fine exercise, a little
drunk perhaps; but the muscles in their breast are so expanded
that they can’t ketch the consumption nor the smaul pox.</p>

<p>Rev. Moses Bickerstaff wrote those famous sermons ov hiz,
that shook the moral firmament from dan to bersheebe, upon
the head ov a flower barrel, with a bony pen made from the
dorsal feather finis ov an untamed osstrich.</p>

<p>He used ink made from an extrakt ov mid-nite, combined
with the perspiration ov a confirmed Ethiopian.</p>

<p>He also kultivated the ambishun ov hiz little finger nail
which grew to bee about 8 feet in longevity.</p>

<p>He had a way ov leering with hiz left eye, when he preached,
which history sez was cussid good.</p>

<p>Bickerstaff haz had a hoste ov immitators, but they are like
the millers who fly at a kandle, he cooks them all.</p>

<p>Bickerstaff wore hiz hat without enny brim to it, nor enny
crown, and alwus put on hiz left boot last. He, like all thoze

<p>Doktor Henry Magnum, M. D., waz a doktor.</p>

<p>He waz rather a weak sister, and alwus rode sideways on a

he waz plumb ded.</p>

<p>His exsentricitys waz theze.</p>

<p>He iz sed to hav had, during his life, a thousand stujents

<p>Docktor Magnum worked in physick about 46 years after
the landing ov the pilgrims, on Mount Arryrat, and i presume
iz now fully dead, and gone, or too old for a full days work.</p>

<p>He wrote a book on rats (az a dire necessity) which waz a

<p>Ten thousand phunny things ov his hav bin handed down,

<p>The most truly wonderful odd awkwardness ov all hiz peculiarness

<p>This natrality ov hiz haz bin immitated so mutch since,
that the original idee iz all wore out.</p>

<p>He haz had several immitators who hav outsmiled their

<p>History sez, he could smile a pint ov gin a day, without

<p>But a pint ov gin, now days, would hardly raize a smile ov
contempt.</p>

<p>Ebenezer Smile was a bachelor, and history sez, his father

<p>This oddness haz also its immitators.</p>

<p>Ebenezer died with a smile on his countenance, or just after
one.</p>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">I</span> kum</span> to the conclusion, lately, that life waz so onsartin,
that the only wa for me tu stand a fair chance with other
folks, was to git my life insured, and so i kalled on the Agent
<span id="pg_404" class="page_anchor">404 </span>
of the “Garden Angel life insurance Co.,” and answered the
following questions, which waz put tu me over the top ov a
pair of goold specks, by a slik little fat old feller, with a little
round gray head, az pretty az enny man ever owned:—</p>


<p>QUESTIONS.</p>

<p>1st—Are yu mail or femail? if so, Pleze state how long you
have been so.</p>

<p>2d—Are yu subjec tu fits, and if so, do yu hav more than
one at a time?</p>

<p>3d—What is yure precise fiteing weight?</p>

<p>4th—Did yu ever have enny ancestors, and if so, how
much?</p>

<p>5th—What iz yure legal opinion ov the constitutionality ov
the 10 commandments.</p>

<p>6th—Du yu ever hav enny nite mares?</p>

<p>7th—Are you married and single, or are yu a Bachelor?</p>

<p>8th—Do yu beleave in a futer state? if yu du, state it.</p>

<p>9th—What are yure private sentiments about a rush ov
rats tu the head; can it be did successfully?</p>

<p>10th—Hav yu ever committed suiside, and if so, how did
it seem to affect yu?</p>

<p>After answering the above questions, like a man in the confirmatif,
the slik little fat old fellow with goold specks on,
ced i was insured for life, and probably would remain so for
a term ov years. I thanked him, and smiled one ov my most
pensive smiles.</p>

<h2 id="sec-167">HOW TEW PICK OUT A GOOD HOSS.</h2>

<p><i>First.</i>—Let the color be a sorrel, a roan, a red, a gray, a
white, a blak, a blue, a green, a chesnut, a brown, a dapple,
a spotted, a cream, a buckskin, or sum other good color.</p>

<p><i>Seckond.</i>—Examin hiz ears; see that he haz got tew ears,
and pound a tin pan cluss to him, to find out whether hiz
hearing iz good. All hosses are dum but a deff and dum
hoss, are not desirable.</p>

<span id="pg_405" class="page_anchor">405 </span>

<p><i>Third.</i>—Look well to hiz eyes; see that he haz got a pupil
in hiz eyes, and not too large a one neither, hosses with too
large pupils in their eyes are near-sighted, and kant see oats,
and hav tew wear green gogles, and green gogles make a hoss
look tu mutch like
a trakt pedlar.</p>

<a href="images/ill-75.jpg"><img src="images/ill-75_min.jpg" alt=""></a>
<p class="caption">THE HOSS.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Fourth.</i>—Feel
ov his neck with
the inside ov yure
right hand, see
that the spinal collum
iz well fatted,
and runs the
whole length ov
him from fore to
aft, a hoss without
a good phatt spinal
collum from
fore to aft aint
worth, (speaking
sudden) aint worth
a well defined cuss.</p>

<p><i>Five.</i>—Put yure
hand on hiz breast, (this iz allowable in the case ov a
quadriped) see if hiz harte kan beat 70, squeeze hiz fore leggs
to see if he iz well muscled, lift up hiz before feet, and see
if thare iz enny frogs in them, frogs keep a hosses feet
cool, and sweet, just az they do a well, or a spring ov water.</p>

<p><i>Six.</i>—Look well tew hiz shoes, see what number he wears,
number 8 iz about right.</p>

<p><i>Seven.</i>—Run yure hand along the dividing ridge ov hiz
boddy, from the top ov hiz withers to the commencement ov
his tail (or dorsul vertibra) and pinch him az yu go along to
see if he knows how tew kick.</p>

<p><i>Eight.</i>—Look on his hind legs for sum spavins, kurbs, windgalls,
ringbones, skratches, quittors, thrush, greaseheels,
thorough-pins, spring-halt, quarter-kracks; see if he haz got a
<span id="pg_406" class="page_anchor">406 </span>
whirl-bone; look for sum pin-hips; hunt for strains in the
back tendons, let-downs and capped hocks.</p>

<p><i>Nine.</i>—Investigate hiz teeth, see if he aint 14 years old last
May, with teeth filed down, and a six year old black mark
burnt into the top ov them, with a hot iron.</p>

<p><i>Ten.</i>—Smell of hiz breath to see if he haint got sum glanders;
look just back ov hiz ears for sighns of pole evil, pinch
him on the top ov hiz withers for a fistula, and look sharp at
both shoulders for a sweeny.</p>

<p><i>Eleven.</i>—Hook him tew a waggon that rattles, drive him
up to an Irishman and hiz wheelbarrow, meet a rag merchant
with cow bells strung acrost the top ov hiz cart, let an express
train pass him at 45 miles to the hour, when he iz swetty
leave a buffalo robe over him to keep oph the cold, ride him
with an unbrel highsted, and learn hiz opinyun ov these things.</p>

<p><i>Twelve.</i>—Prospekt hiz wind, sarch diligently for the heaves,
ask if he iz a roarer, and don’t be afraid tew find out if he iz
a whistler.</p>

<p><i>Thirteen.</i>—Be sure that he aint a krib-biter, aint balky,
aint a weaver, and dont pull at the halter.</p>

<hr>

<p>Theze are a few simple things to be looked at in buying a
<i>good family hoss</i>, there iz a grate menny other things tew be
looked at (at yure leizure) after you have bought him.</p>

<p>Good hosses are skarse, and good men, that deal in enny
kind ov hosses, are skarser.</p>

<p>Ask a man all about hiz wife and he may tell you, examine
him cluss for a Sunday school teacher and find him all on the
square, send him tew the New York legislature and rejoice
that money wont buy him, lend him seven hundred dollars,
in the highway, without witness or note, even swop dorgs with
him with perfekt impunity, but when yu buy a <i>good family
hoss</i> ov him, young, sound, and trew, watch the man cluss, and
make up yure mind besides that you will have tew ask the
Lord tew forgive him.</p>

if it want for enny beans, thare wouldn’t be enny suckertash.</p>

<p>Agrikultur waz fust diskovered by Cain, and has been diskovered
since to be an honest way to get a hard living.</p>

<p>Pumpkins owes aul her success tew agrikultur, so duz lettis,
and bukwheat.</p>

<p>The Billingsville agrikultural society opened Oct. ten, and
waz a powerful success.</p>

<p>The reciepts ov the Agrikultural Fair waz upwards ov $30,000
(if mi memry serves me rite, and i think she duz.)</p>

<p>The Hon. Virgil Bickerstaff, the next agrikultural member
ov Congress from our district, sold the agrikultur pools.</p>

<h3 id="sec-168-2">FUST DAY.</h3>

<p>A puss ov ten dollars was trotted for by sucking colts, that
had never trotted before for munny.</p>

<p>Thare waz thirteen entries.</p>

<p>Thare waz 60,000 people on the track to witness the rase,
(if mi memry serves me rite, and i think she duz.)</p>

<p>The puss was won amid vociferous exclamashuns by a red
colt, and the waving ov handkerchiefs, with a strip in his face,
and the fainting ov several fust-class females, and one white
foot behind.</p>

<h3 id="sec-168-3">SEKOND DAY.</h3>

<p>It rained like a perpendikular aul day, and no trotting could
be had, so the audience aul went hum, cussing and swaring,
and offering tew bet four tew six on the Pete Tucker colt.</p>

<span id="pg_408" class="page_anchor">408 </span>

<h3 id="sec-168-4">THIRD DAY.</h3>

<p>The sun highsted up in the east more butyfuller than I
ever saw her before, (if mi memry serves me rite, and i think
she does.)</p>

<p>It waz a fust rate day for agrikultur, or enny other man.</p>

<p>A puss ov 30 dollars waz trotted for, by sum 2 year old
colts.</p>

<p>This rase did not attract much affection, on account ov the
time being so slow.</p>

<p>Time, 2 minnits and 38 seconds.</p>

<h3 id="sec-168-5">FOURTH DAY.</h3>

<p>This waz fur 3 or 4 years old, who hadn’t never beat 2.25.</p>

<p>Thare waz 26 entrys; they couldn’t aul trot tew once, so
they took turns.</p>

<p>This rase waz won after a bitter contest, by Pete Tucker’s
colt.</p>

<p>He waz immediately offered a thousand dollars and a fust-rate
farm, well-stocked, for the colt, by three different agrikultural
men, but with a grate deal ov indignant good sense,
he skorned to stoop so low.</p>

<p>Pete Tucker, and his whole family, are aul hoss.</p>

<h3 id="sec-168-6">FIFTH DAY.</h3>

<p>It rained agin like thunder and lightning, and the day waz
spent in betting on the weight ov hosses.</p>

<p>Sevral good hoss-swops waz also did.</p>

<p>One man swopped two hosses fur one; this struck me as a
devilish good thing, but everyboddy else said it waz soft.</p>

<p>At the end ov the fifth day i cum away.</p>

<p>I got so full ov hoss, that ever since when i laff i kant keep
from whinnering.</p>

<p>The fare waz kept up for 10 daze, and sum red hot time
waz made.</p>

<p>I think 2 minnits and 10 sekonds waz made, (if my memry
serves me rite, and i think she duz.)</p>

<p>I forgot tew say that thare was two yoke ov oxens on the
<span id="pg_409" class="page_anchor">409 </span>
ground, beside sevral yokes ov sheep and a pile ov carrots,
and some worsted work, but they didn’t seem to attrakt enny

<h2 id="sec-169">OATS.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">O</span>ats</span> are a singular grain, perhaps I should say plural,
bekauze thare iz more than one ov them.</p>

<p>They gro on the top ov a straw, about two foot, 9 and one
quarter inches hi, and the straw iz holler.</p>

<p>This straw iz interesting for its sukshun.</p>

<p>Short pieces ov it, about 8 inches, or so, dipt into the
buzzum ov a sherry cobbler, will suckshun up the entire cobbler
in 4 minnitts, bi the watch.</p>

<p>I never hav tried this, but i kno lots ov young, and
reliable men, who stand around reddy to prove this, if sum
boddy will fetch on the cobbler.</p>

<p>This suckshun iz sed tew be a ded sure thing.</p>

<p>I hav been told bi a man, who iz a grate traveller, that
in the game ov pharaoh, it iz the “splits” that win.</p>

<p>If this iz true, (reasoning from analogy), I have thought
that the splits in the straw mite be in favour ov the cobbler
and agin the suckshun.</p>

<p>But i aint certain ov this, in fakt i hav lost confidence in
most everything, that haz to be proved, since i got so awfully
dizzy, about four years ago, trieing to prove to the chaplain
ov an engine company, that lager beer waz not intoxikating,
but waz full sister to filtered rane water.</p>

<p>If i had time i would relate more about this circumstanse,
but i must git back onto oats agin.</p>

<p>I like tew see a man stik tite tew hiz text, if he haz to
bite into it to do it.</p>

<p>I should have made a profitable minister az fur az staying
with a text iz concerned, for when i git through with a text,
<span id="pg_410" class="page_anchor">410 </span>
yu kant work what’s left ov it into ennything else, not even
a rag karpet.</p>

<p>Speaking ov rag karpets, brings mi wife tew mi
mind.</p>

<p>Mi wife haz got a kind ov hidraphoby, or burning fever ov
sum kind, for rag karpets in the rag, and i don’t have but
one pair ov clothes at a time on this ackount, and theze
i put to sleep, under mi pillo, at nite, when i go tew
bed.</p>

<p>She watches mi clothes just az cluss az a mule duz a bistander,
and i hav told all ov mi best friends, if i am ever lost, and
kant be found soon, they may look for me in mi wifes last
roll of rag karpet.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill-75">
<a href="images/ill-76.jpg"><img src="images/ill-76_min.jpg" alt="OATS MAKE A HOSSE LAFF."></a>
</div>

<p>But for all this, i love mi wife with the affeckshun ov a
parent, (she iz sevral years inferior to me in age,) and i had
rather be rag karpeted bi her, than tew be honey fugled, with
warm apple sass, bi enny other woman. But i must git back
onto oats agin. Oats
gro on the summit ov
sum straw, and are
sharp at both ends.</p>

<p>They resemble shu
pegs in looks, and
build, and it iz sed,
are often mistaken for
them by near-sighted
hosses and shumakers.</p>

<p>I dont intend this
remark az enny derogativeness
to shumakers
in the lump, for i
hav often sed, in mi
inspired moments, if
i couldn’t be a shumaker,
i would like to
be a good lawyer.</p>

<p>Oats are a phuny grain, 8 quarts of them will make even a
<span id="pg_411" class="page_anchor">411 </span>
stage hoss laff, and when a stage hoss laffs, you may know he
is tickled somewhare.</p>

<p>This iz the natur ov oats as a beverage, they amuze the
stummuck ov the hoss with their sharp ends, and then the
hoss laffs.</p>

<p>I hav never saw a hoss laff, but i hav heard that it could
be did.</p>

<p>Thare iz a grate menny folks, ov good moral karakter, who
wont believe enny thing unless they kan see it, theze kind
of folk are always the eazyest to cheat.</p>

<p>They wont beleave a rattle snaiks bight iz pizon untill they
tri it, this kind of informashun alwus kosts more than it iz
aktually worth.</p>

<p>It iz a middling wize man who proffits bi hiz own experience,
but it iz a good deal wizer one, who lets the rattle-snaik
bight the other phellow.</p>

<p>The Goddess ov korn iz also the the Goddess ov oats, and
barley, and bukwheat.</p>

<p>Her name iz Series, she is a mithological woman, and like
menny wimmen now a daze, she iz hard tew lokate.</p>

<p>Theze mithology men, and wimmin, work well enuff in
poetry, whare a good deal ov lieing dont hurt the sense, but
when you cum right down to korn in the ear, or oats in the
bundle, all the gods and goddesses in the world, kant warrent
a good crop.</p>

<p>It takes labor tew raize oats, and thrash them out, but ov
all the lazy cusses that hav pestered the earth, since Adam
waz a boy, the gods, and goddesses, hav always been too lazy
to swet.</p>

<p>Enny being who haint never swet, dont kno what he iz
worth.</p>

<p>I would like to see a whole parcell ov theze gods, and
goddesses, in a harvest field, reaping lodged oats, in the month
of August, they couldn’t earn their pepper-sass.</p>

<p>Oats are sold bi weight or mezzure, and are seldum (or
perhaps i may say in confidence never) sold by count.</p>

<p>Eggs, and money, are counted out, but oats never.</p>

<span id="pg_412" class="page_anchor">412 </span>

<p>It would be well for nu beginners to remember this, it
would save them a good deal of time on every hundred
bushels ov oats.</p>

<p>Time iz sed tew be the same az money, if this iz positively
so, Methuseler died ritch.</p>

<p>Methuseler waz exackly 999 years old when he died, now
multipli this bi 365, which would only be allowing him a
dollar a day for hiz time, and yu will find just what he waz
worth.</p>

<p>Oats are worth from 40, to 75 cents a bushel, ackording
tew their price, and aint good for mutch, only tew tickle a
hoss.</p>

<p>They will choke a goose to deth quicker than a paper of
pins, and enny thing that will choke a goose to deth (i mean
on the internal side ov their thrut) iz, to say the least ov it,
very skarse.</p>

<p>Speaking ov a goose, i hav found out at last what makes
them so tuff, it iz staying out so mutch in the cold.</p>

<p>I found this out all alone by miself.</p>

<p>Oats are a very eazy krop tew raize.</p>

<p>All yu hav got to do, to raize sum oats, iz to plough the
ground deep, then manure it well, then sprinkle the oats all
over the ground, one in a place, then worry the ground with
a drag all over, then set up nites tew keep the chickens, and
woodchucks out ov them, then pray for sum rain, then kradle
them down with a kradle, then rake them together with a
rake, then bind them up with a band, then stack them up in
a stack, then thrash them out with a flail, then clean them
up with a mill, then sharpen both ends ov them with a knife,
then stow them away in a granery, then spend wet days, and
Sundays, trapping for rats, and mice.</p>

<p>It aint nothing but phun tew raize oats—try it.</p>

<p>One ov the best ways tew raize a sure crop ov oats, and
tew git a good price for the crop, iz tew feed 4 quarts ov
them tew a shanghi rooster then murder the rooster suddenly,
and sell him for 25 cents a pound, crop and all.</p>

at the korners ov his mouth, like a thing ov life, then busts
its bonds ov buty, and fills the air for a moment with a

<p>It was fust diskovered by the deck hands on a lake Erie
steam Boat, and handed down by them tew posterity in awl
its juvenile beauty.</p>

<p>It is generally played by 4 persons and owes mutch ov its
absorbingness tew the fackt that yu kan talk, and drink, and
chaw, and cheat while the game is advancing.</p>

<p>I have seen it played on the Hudson River Railroad, in the
smoking cars, with more immaculate skill than ennywhare
else.</p>

<p>If yu play thare, yu will often hold a hand that will astonish
you, quite often 4 queens and a 10 spot, which will inflame
you to bate 7 or 8 dollars that it is a good hand tew play poker
with; but you will be more astonished when you see the
other feller’s hand, which invariably consists ov 4 kings and
a one spot.</p>

<p>Yewker is a mollatto game, and don’t compare tew old
sledge in majesty, enny more than the game ov pin does to
a square church raffle.</p>

<p>I never play yewker.</p>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">I</span> hav</span> finally com tew the konclusion, that <i>lager beer</i> iz
not intoxikatin.</p>

<p>I hav been told so bi a german, who sed he had drank it
aul nite long, just tew tri the experiment, and was obliged
tew go home entirely sober in the morning. I hav seen this
same man drink sixteen glasses, and if he was drunk, he was
drunk in german, and noboddy could understand it. It iz
proper enuff tew state, that this man kept a lager-beer saloon,
and could have no object in stating what want strictly thus.</p>

<p>I beleaved him tew the full extent ov mi ability. I never
drank but 3 glasses ov lager beer in mi life, and that made
my hed untwist, as tho it was hung on the end ov a string,
but i was told that it was owing tew my bile being out ov
place, and I guess that it was so, for I never biled over wuss
than i did when I got home that nite. Mi wife was afrade i
was agoing tew die, and i was almoste afrade i shouldn’t, for
it did seem az tho evrything i had ever eaten in mi life, was
cuming tew the surface, and i do really beleave, if mi wife
hadn’t pulled oph mi boots, just az she did, they would have
cum thundering up too.</p>

<p>Oh, how sick i was! it was 14 years ago, and i kan taste it
now.</p>

<p>I never had so much experience, in so short a time.</p>

<p>If enny man should tell me that lager beer was not intoxikating,
i should beleave him; but if he should tell me that i
want drunk that nite, but that my stummuk was only out ov
order, i should ask him tew state over, in a few words, just
how a man felt and akted when he was well set up.</p>

<p>If i want drunk that nite, i had sum ov the moste natural
simptoms a man ever had, and keep sober.</p>

<p>In the fust place, it was about 80 rods from whare i drank
the lager, tew my house, and i was over 2 hours on the road,
and had a hole busted thru each one ov mi pantaloon kneeze,
and didn’t hav enny hat, and tried tew open the door by the
bell-pull, and hickupped awfully, and saw evrything in the
<span id="pg_417" class="page_anchor">417 </span>
room tryin tew git round onto the back side ov me, and in
setting down onto a chair, i didn’t wait quite long enuff for it
tew git exactly under me, when it was going round, and i sett
down a little too soon, and missed the chair by about 12
inches, and couldn’t git up quick enuff tew take the next
one when it cum, and that ain’t aul; mi wife sed i waz az
drunk az a beast, and az i sed before, i begun tew spit up
things freely.</p>

drunk enny when hiz bile want plumb.</p>

<p>I don’t want tew say ennything against a harmless tempranse
bevridge, but if i ever drink enny more it will be with
mi hands tied behind me, and mi mouth pried open.</p>

<p>I don’t think lager beer iz intoxikating, but if i remember

<h2 id="sec-173">LAUGHING.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">I</span>t</span> never haz been proved, that enny ov the animal kreation
hav attempted tew laff, (we are quite certain that none
hav succeded;) thus this deliteful episode and pleasant power
appears tew be entirely within the province ov humans.</p>

<p>It iz the language ov infancy—the eloquense ov childhood,—and
the power tew laff is the power to be happy.</p>

<p>It is becoming tew awl ages and conditions; and (with the
very few exceptions, sakred tew sorrow) an honest, hearty laff
iz always agreeable and in order.</p>

<p>It iz an index ov karakter, and betrays sooner than words.—Laffing
keeps oph sickness, and haz conquered az menny
diseases az ever pills have, and at mutch less expense.—It
makes flesh, and keeps it in its place. It drives away weariness
and brings a dream ov sweetness tew the sleeper.—It
never iz covetous.—It ackompanys charity, and iz the handmaid
ov honesty.—It disarms revenge, humbles pride, and
iz the talisman ov kontentment.—Sum have kalled it a weakness—a
substitute for thought, but really it strengthens wit,
and adorns wisdum, invigorates the mind, gives language
ease, and expreshun elegance.—It holds the mirror up tew
<span id="pg_419" class="page_anchor">419 </span>
beauty; it strengthens modesty, and makes virtew heavenly.</p>

<p>It iz the light ov life; without it we should be but animated
ghosts.</p>

<p>It challenges fear, hides sorrow, weakens despair, and carries
haff ov poverty’s bundles.—It costs nothing, comes at
the call, and leaves a brite spot behind.—It iz the only index
ov gladness, and the only buty that time kannot effase.—It
never grows old; it reaches from the cradle clear tew the
grave.</p>

<p>Without it, love would be no pashun, and fruition would
show no joy.—It iz the fust and the last sunshine that visits
the heart; it was the warm welkum ov Eden’s lovers, and was
the only capital that sin left them tew begin bizzness with
outside the Garden ov Paradise.</p>

<h2 id="sec-174">THE ADVENT NO. 2.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> seckund adventists, and adventisses, are a people ov
slo growth, but remarkabel vigor and grate endurance.
They have been to work, with both hands, for about thirty
years, to mi knowledge, in bringing this world tew her milk;
and tho often outfigured in the arithmetick ov events, they
rub out the slate, and begin agin.</p>

<p>Like all other moral enthusiasts for right or wrong, they
tap the bible for their nourishment, and several times, so they
say, hav only missed in their kalculations, but about two
inches, which iz mighty cluss for so big a thing.</p>

<p>The time haz bin sott, at least a dozen times since i hav bin
an inhabitant in this country, and when i waz a boy, az tender,
and az green az celery, i kan rekolekt with mi memory, ov
having awful palpitations in the naberhood ov the knee-pans,
upon one ov the eventful days, and crawled under the barn,
not to be in the way.</p>

<p>But az i grew older—if i didn’t gro enny wizer—I had the
<span id="pg_420" class="page_anchor">420 </span>
satisfackshun ov growing bigger, and more less afrade ov
advents.</p>

<p>I cum tew the konklusion, sum time since, that Divine
Providence treated the world, without enny ov the succor or
scientifick attainments ov man, and he probably would be
able to destroy it in the same way.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill-78">
<a href="images/ill-79.jpg"><img src="images/ill-79_min.jpg" alt=""></a>
</div>

<p>I hav alwus thought, judgeing from what little i hav bin
able tew pick, that
waz lieing around
loose, ov man’s internal
natur, thet if the
world hadn’t bin bilt,
before man waz, he
probably wouldn’t
hav bin satizfied if he
couldn’t hav put in
hiz lip.</p>

<p>Man iz an uneazy
kritter, and luvs tew
tell how things ought
tew be bilt and haz
got jist impudence
enuff tew offer his
valuable services tew
the Lord espeshily in
the way ov advice.</p>

<p>Now I am confidently ov the opinyun that the world will
sumtime be knocked out ov time; it hain’t got the least partickle
ov immotality about it, that I hav bin able tew diskover,
it iz az certain tew di az man iz, and i think enny boddy, who
will take slate, and pencil, and straddle a chair calmly, and
cypher out the earth’s death to day, iz no wizer; nor less
imprudent and wicked, than if he figgured on hiz nabors
phunneral, and then blabbed it all around town.</p>

<p>The bible that i was brought up on, sez: “that the son of
man cometh like a thief in the night,” and evry boddy knows,
that the fust intimashun we hav ov a thief’s visit iz, that he
haz been here, and left.</p>

<span id="pg_421" class="page_anchor">421 </span>

<p>Thare iz a large share ov the students, in the secund advent
dokter stuff, that are pupils ov pitty, they cum into this world,
not only naked, but without enny brains, nor enny place suitable
tew put enny, the fust bizzness, ov enny consequence they
do, iz to begin to wonder, and it ain’t long before the phool
nuss picks them up, and givs them a stiddy job.</p>

<p>This iz the way the common adventer iz made, and if he
aint a stool pidgeon for life in the second advent speckulashun,
he iz in sum other cuming thing, with a hole in the bottom
ov it, for enny man who iz eazy to phool, loves to be
phooled.</p>

<p>The fust originators ov phalse doktrines, are most alwus
dupes tew their own ignorance, but if the doctrine seems tew
he a hit, then yu will see men ov brains, who ought tew be
ashamed ov sich wickedness, take the masheen bi the crank,
and run it.</p>

<p>I dont know whether Mr. Miller waz the inventor ov this
seckond advent abortion or not, but if he waz, i will bet a
haff pint ov peenuts, and pay whether i win or lose, that he
waz a phatt, lazy old simpleton who lived on a back road, az
ignorant ov the bible az a kuntry hoss doktor iz ov medicin.</p>

<p>I am alwus reddy tew pitty, and forgiv a phool, espeshily
when he dont step on enny boddy but himself.</p>

<p>Thare iz one thing about theze enthusiasts that iz phair,
and rather remarkable for humbuggers, they destroy themselfs,
az well az the rest ov us, at the same pop.</p>

<p>Mi opinyun iz, if the worl should consent tew cum tew an
end, to suit their reckoning, they would be az skared a sett
ov carpet-baggers, az yu could find, and be the fust ones to
say, that the figgures had lied.</p>

<p>I am willing tew dubble mi haff pint bet ov peenuts, and
make it a pint, that thare aint a Millerite now living, nor ever
agoing tew liv, whom yu could git tew take 87 1-2 cents in
change for a dollar greenback, or who would giv a dubble
price for a breakfasst, on the morning ov the day that iz sott
for the worlds destrukshun.</p>

<p>This waz looked
upon az kussid
smart, and every
boddy laffed.</p>

<p>I did not see enny
thing phunny in
it, and so i didn’t
laff.</p>

<p>The water at
Long Branch iz
verry plenty, and
will last for menny
years to cum, if
they are saving ov
it. They told me
that the water at Long Branch waz good for the fidgit, and
the conipshun.</p>

<p>I think if the water waz strained, and the mineral got out
ov it, i might worry down sum ov it.</p>

<p>I took a jug ov the water home, and tried it on mi aunt,
who haz a fidgit once in a while, but she didn’t hanker for it
but once.</p>

<p>I sent a vial ov it tew our minister, and the next Sunday
hiz text waz, “if psalt has lost its saver, whare shall it be
psalted.”</p>

<p>While i waz at Long Branch i think thare waz more than
<span id="pg_426" class="page_anchor">426 </span>
a millyun ov people cum and went, and i didn’t hear one ov
them find enny phalt with the taste ov the water.</p>

<p>I shall go down thare next spring early, and stay thare till
i learn how tew like the water.</p>

<p>While at Long Branch i put up at the Continental hotel,
which iz handy to the water.</p>

<p>This hotel is 7 hundred feet long, and one hundred and
sixty-five feet thick, and the water iz lokated just about in
front ov the middle ov the hotel.</p>

<p>The landlord ov this hotel iz a very clever phellow, and
told me he had kept the house 5 years, and couldn’t drink the
water yet with mutch suckcess.</p>

<p>His name iz W. H. Borrows, and i reckomend him to all
who are in search ov a landlord.</p>

<p>I went from Long Branch to Saratoga immejiately and begun
to drink.</p>

<p>I don’t think the water at Saratoga iz so mineral az at Long
Branch.</p>

<p>I staid at Saratoga four weeks, and worked away at the
water all the time.</p>

<p>The more i drinkt, the less i wanted to.</p>

<p>The water ain’t so numerous at Saratoga, az it iz at Long
Branch, and that iz the reason whi they bottle it.</p>

<p>I stopt at the Grand Union Hotel while at Saratoga, and
noticed several people thare.</p>

<p>This hotel iz kept by the <i>Lelands</i>, and iz kept just az i
should keep hotel, if i waz a going tew keep one.</p>

<p>I always thought it waz dredful easy to keep a good hotel,
and after staying 4 weeks at the Grand Union I know it iz.</p>

<p>The clerks at this hotel are a hansum set ov phellows and
they all told me they knew how to drink the water.</p>

<p>I shall cum here next summer and stop at this same hotel,
if they will let me, and i shall keep comeing year after year,
until i learn how to finally drink the water.</p>

<p>From Saratoga i went to Lake George.</p>

<p>I went by the Adirondax ralerode, and found it a most delitesum
route, besides being mutch the cheapest.</p>

<span id="pg_427" class="page_anchor">427 </span>

<p>One reason ov this waz bekauze the superintendant ov the
rode presented me with a pass to go and cum.</p>

<p>I kan say to all who are going to Lake George to drink the
waters, yu had better go by the Adirondax route yu will git
less dust and more shade; yu will find good stages, jolly drivers,
kind agents, and just az like az not, a free pass for yourself
and wife.</p>

<p>I reached Lake George in time to drink before dinner, and
couldn’t taste enny psalt in the water.</p>

<p>I waz suprized at this, and concluded i had injured mi taste.</p>

<p>I tried the water the next morning, and found them still
unsalty, and paid mi bill, and left.</p>

<p>The landlord asked me, with tears in hiz eyes, what waz
the matter, and i whispered in hiz ear that the water lakt
psalt.</p>

<p>He begged mi pardon, and offered tew fix sum for me.</p>

<p>I left Lake George with the firm convikshun that the water
iz too fresh tew be proffitable.</p>

<p>Sumthing was sed tew me about the scenery around Lake
George being so fine; but i didn’t go for scenery, i went for
water.</p>

<p>After spending eleven weeks ov pure, unspekeled happiness,
i find miself at hum agin, feeling like a birde, but a
leetle water-soaked.</p>

<p>I shall start in a phew days for Utaw, and shall spend the
winter thare, and praktiss on the waters.</p>

<p>I am told that the waters at psalt lake are more substanshall
tew drink than enny others.</p>

<p>I shall visit Brigham Young while i am thare, and study
pollygamy.</p>

<p>If pollygamy iz a blessing, the quicker we all find it out
the better.</p>

<p>I forgot to state that i saw one man at Saratoga drink 9
glasses ov mineral water konsekutiff. They sed he waz a
sailor—a regular old psalt.</p>

<p>I also saw one man at Long Branch drink more water than
he could swaller. He cum very near drounding to deth.</p>

<p>But thare iz excepshuns tew the general rule.</p>

<p>She makes them worth fifty cents, the fust she makes,

<h2 id="sec-178">NEW ASHFORD.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> village ov New Ashford iz lokated in the state ov
Massachusetts, and iz about 150 miles west ov Plymouth
rok.</p>

<span id="pg_429" class="page_anchor">429 </span>

<p>It iz one ov them towns that dont make enny fuss, but for
pure water, pure morals, and good rye, and injun bread, it
stands on tiptoze.</p>

<p>It waz settled soon after the landing ov the pilgrims, bi sum
ov that party, and like all the Nu England towns, waz, at one
time, selebrated for its stern religious creed, and its excellent
rum and tanzy.</p>

<p>It may seem a leetle strange, tew these latter day saints, tew
hear me mix up rum and religion together, but i had an Unkle,
who preached God’s word in the next town south ov New
Ashford, 80 years ago, who died in due time, and went to
heaven.</p>

<p>This genial old saint alwus took, on week daze, three magnificent
horns ov rum and tanzy, and Sundaze he took four.</p>

<p>I hav no doubt it lengthened out hiz time, and braced up
hiz faith.</p>

<p>But i wouldn’t advise enny ov the yung klergy ov to-day
tew meddle with rum and tanzy, az a fertilizer.</p>

<p>The tanzy iz all rite—it grows az green and az bitter az
ever; for man kant adulturate it, but the rum haz bin bedeviled
into rank pizon.</p>

<p>One sich horn az mi old unkle used tew absorb between hiz
sermons on Sunday (5 inches, good and strong) would disfranchise
a whole drove ov preachers now.</p>

<p>In them daze, the preacher waz a stalwart man, and could
mo his swarth in the hay field, with the best ov them, and
could ride a hard trotting cob or a hoss, 6 miles an hour, all
day, akrost the mountains, and set doun at night, to biled
pork and kabbage, and kold injun puddin, and after thanking
the Lord for his menny mersys, eat hiz way klean to the
middle ov the table.</p>

<p>But times, and men, hav altered, and so haz rum and
tanzy.</p>

<p>I dont want them good old times tew cum back agin, we
aint pure enuff now tew stand them, neither are we tuff enuff.</p>

<p>Our virtews may be az pure in the eyes ov heaven, but
they kant stand the biled pork, and rum, ov one hundred
years ago.</p>

<span id="pg_430" class="page_anchor">430 </span>

<p>We are told that mankind are growing weaker and wizer;
weaker i admit, but wisdum that is gained at the expense ov
simplicity may be a doubtful gain.</p>

<p>I never hav met an old man yet, who didn’t mourn the
degeneracy ov the times.</p>

<p>Wisdum don’t konsist in knowing more that iz new, but in
knowing less that iz false.</p>

<p>But, dear Mr. ——, i will now git back tew whare i am,
and tell yu sumthin about New Ashford.</p>

<p>If yu luv a mountain, cum up here and see me.</p>

<p>Right in front ov the little tavern, whare i am staying, rizes
up a chunk ov land, that will make yu feel weak tew look at
it.</p>

<p>I hav bin on its top, and far above waz the brite blu ski,
without a kloud swimming in it, while belo me the rain shot
slanting on the valley, and the litening played its mad pranks.</p>

<p>How is this for hi?</p>

<p>But what a still place this New Ashford iz.</p>

<p>At sunrize the roosters crow all around, once apiece; at
sunset the cows cum hollering home tew be milked; and at
twilite out steal the krickets, with a song, the burden ov
which seems sad and weary.</p>

<p>This iz all the racket thare iz in New Ashford. It iz so
still here that you can hear a feather drop from a blujay’s
tail.</p>

<p>Out ov this mountain, squeezed bi the weight ov it, leaks
a little brook ov water, and up and down this brook each day
i loiter.</p>

<p>In mi hand i hav a short pole, on the end ov the pole a
short line, on the line a sharp hook, looped on the hook a
grub, or a worm.</p>

<p>Every now and and then thare cums dancing out ov this
little brook a live trout no longer than yure finger, but az
sweet az a stick ov kandy, and in he goes at the top ov mi
baskit.</p>

<p>This iz what i am here for; trout for breakfast, trout for
dinner and trout for supper.</p>

<span id="pg_431" class="page_anchor">431 </span>

<p>I am az happy and az lazy az a yerling heifer.</p>

<p>I hav not a kare on mi mind, not an ake in mi boddy.</p>

<p>I haven’t read a nuzepaper for a week, and wouldn’t read
one for a dollar.</p>

<p>I shall stay here till mi munny givs out, and shall cum bak
tew the senseless
crash ov the city,
with a tear in mi eye,
and holes in both ov
mi boots.</p>

<p>This world iz phull
ov fun, but most
pholks look too hi
for it.</p>

<p>On one side ov
this mountain they
say thare iz rattlesnaix,
on that side of
the mountain, iz
whare i dont go.</p>

<p>I am just az fraid
ov a snaix as a woman
iz, i had rather
meet the devil, ennytime,
on a bust, than a three foot snaik. A striped snaik in
the morning spiles the rest ov that day for me.</p>

<p>I am coming home, dear Friends in two months, and then
i will set down, in yure little sanktum, and whisper to you.</p>

<p>It iz so still here, that a whisper sounds loud; a still noize
iz another name, i beleave, for happiness. The bible sez:
“<i>peace, be still</i>.”</p>

<p>The fust thing i do in the morning, when i git up, iz tew
go out and look at the mountain, and see if it iz thare, if this
mountain should go away, how lonesum i should be.</p>

<p>Yesterday i picked one quart ov field strawberrys, kaught
27 trout, and gathered a whole parcell ov wintergreen leaves,
a big daze work.</p>

<span id="pg_432" class="page_anchor">432 </span>

<p>When i got home last night tired, no man kould hav bought
them ov me for 700 dollars, but i suppoze, after all, that it
waz the <i>tired</i> that waz wuth the munny.</p>

<p>Thare is a grate deal ov raw bliss, in gitting tired.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. ——, good-bye, it iz now 9 <ins title="Note: “oclk” in the original" id="cg_67">clok</ins>, P. M., and every
thing, in New Ashford, iz fast asleep, inkluding the krickets,
I will just step out and see if the mountain iz thare, and then
I will go to bed too.</p>

<p>Oh! the bliss ov living up in New Ashford, cluss bi the
side ov a grate giant mountain tew guard yu, whare every
thing iz az still as a boys tin whissell at midnite, a musketo
couldn’t liv long enuff tew take one bite, whare board iz only
4 dollars a week, and everyboddy, kats and all, at 9 clok,

<h2 id="sec-179">BENDS.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">H</span>istorians</span> and biographers having refused tew giv
enny transparent account ov the various <i>Bends</i> that
hav got into things, us naturalists have passed a resolushun
tew take them up az a kind ov estrays, and tew treat of them
in a joyful and flexible manner.</p>

<p>The most butiful, az well az truest bilt <i>Bend</i>, in this grate
republick, iz the rainbow.</p>

<p>For the informashun ov the scholler we shall simply state
that this <i>Bend</i> iz only seen in the east, and haz not yet reached
the west, altho the enterprising people who liv in thoze
parts undoubtedly will soon hav them, on a mutch bigger and
improved plan.</p>

<p><i>Bends</i> are both natral and artyfishall, and among the natral
ones it will, perhaps, be well enuff tew menshun north <i>Bend</i>,
in the State ov Ohio, the home ov General Harrison, formerly
a President ov the grate republick; and also south <i>Bend</i>, in
the State ov Indiana, the residence ov Schuyler Colfax, who,
while i am putting down these remarks, iz running very fast
for the Vice Presidency ov this grate republick with a certainty
ov winning that iz butiful tew behold.</p>

<p>(Later—He haz won.)</p>

<span id="pg_433" class="page_anchor">433 </span>

<p>Another wonderful and awe-inspiring <i>Bend</i> in this grate
republick is the political <i>Bend</i>.</p>

<p>This <i>Bend</i> iz az common and az limber az the figger 8.</p>

<p>It kan stand on her hed, or on her feet, or lay down on her
side, and be the same thing all the time.</p>

<p>It kan turn a summerset over backwards, or back a summersett
over forwards.</p>

<p>Menny ov our most noble pollyticians hav bent theirselfs
in diffrent spots so often that they travel like a sick snake.</p>

<p>Thare iz one little <i>Bend</i>, prakticed bi both old and young
men, that haz opened the way for more anguish than awl the
other crooks in the world put in a heap together, i mean the
elbo <i>Bend</i>, that cauzes the mout tew fly apart on its hinges,
and let the burglar whiskee tew rob the brain ov its patrimony
reazon, and illuminate the soul with the torchlights ov the
devil.</p>

<p>In life matrimonial we hav the conjugaler <i>Bend</i>, which
brings a man down on the hard pan ov hiz knees, and makes
him az eazy, and interesting tew handle as a rat in a steel
trap.</p>

<p>This iz a good <i>Bend</i> tew take once in a while, but never
ought tew git chronick.</p>

<p>This puts me in mind tew soliliquize az follows:—a household,
with a woman at the top ov it, and a man at the bottom
ov it, iz one ov thoze concerns whare the wife haz authority
without power, whare the yung ones are sassy without reproach,
and whare the husband iz meek without virtew.</p>

<p>In fashionabel life a new <i>Bend</i> haz just appeared, (August
19th, 1868,) which iz under the patronage ov both genders,
the fop and the belle.</p>

<p>This iz a dorsal <i>Bend</i> near the back fin, and gives the
wearers ov it, when in moshun, the appearance ov a hen turkey
making for a woodshed in a heavy shower ov rain.</p>

<p>I kno ov no meaning or apology for this crook, only the
name ov it, it iz called the Grecian <i>Bend</i>, which iz expekted
tew sanktify it.</p>

<p>I don’t kno how the present inhabitants ov Greece do their
<span id="pg_434" class="page_anchor">434 </span>
travelling; they are about played out, and may be hump
backed. But if Solan, the ancient wisdom maker and law-giver
ov Athens, had caught one ov hiz gals with this gorge
in her back, i will bet 10 dollars he would hav ordered it
taken oph with a jack-plane.</p>

<p>How long this knapsack gait will continnew to be fashionabel
in New York, the home ov folly, whare just now it iz being
experimented with, i am unabel tew reply, but i hope not
long enuff tew transmit the hump tew posterity.</p>

<p>I love mi fair yung countrywimmin with a gladness bordering
on delirium tremens, and when a native ov Madagascar,
not more than haff civilized, asked me the other day, on
Broadway, what ailed all the yung squaws he met, i waz
forced tew hide a tear, and reply hurriedly, in lo Duch:</p>

<p>“Nix for stix!” and shook oph the Madagaskine cuss
quick.</p>

<p>I don’t know ov but one thing now that but few would
hanker for, if it should ever bekum fashionabel again, and
that iz good, square, pony-bilt common sense, without
enny <i>Bend</i> in it.</p>

<p>Common sense in these times haz tew beg for a living.</p>

<p>What an awful thing it would be if this Grecian <i>Bend</i>
should refuse tew let go its holt, by-and-by, when sum nu
crook in sum other part ov the boddy should hump itself!
What a lot ov unsaleable females we should hav thrust on the
market!</p>

<p>I am in favour ov enny fashion that iz not an open insult tew
natur, but i kant bear tew see natur hit in the small ov the
back; it iz a cowardly blow on an aimabel critter, whose greatest
pleasure iz tew harm noboddy.</p>

hard to skare, and able to show 2:40 to a road waggon.</p>

<p>The power ov a comik essa resides in its idea, either original
or admirably stolen, not in its words, strung out lazily like
a snake sunning himself in the sand.</p>

<p>It iz no place for yure short essayer to hide among the
debris ov abstrakted thoughts, or skulk behind a flame colored
paragraff, or doze in recital upon an ebb tide, or hammer out
an iron proposishun into points more or less dull, or quote
latin, or bad french, but he must be az short az a nuzeboy’s
prayer, az sudden az the end ov a rope, az quick az a sneeze,
and az brilliant in hiz busts az a ski rocket.</p>

<span id="pg_439" class="page_anchor">439 </span>

<p>Awl real strength iz short; thinks are broke, or histed
with a jerk; comik essayers must ram pages into paragraffs;
wit, or humor, iz something like ginger pop—thar is about
as mutch in the pop, that is interesting, as thare iz in the ginger.</p>

<p>Theze short essays are like buckwheat slap-jacks; evryboddy
seems tew like them hot, and tew git them hot iz jest where
the little joker cums in.</p>

<p>A lukewarm comik essay haz no more fun in it than a
Dutch konumdrum tew a man who don’t understand the
language.</p>

<p>I often git letters from sum of our best philanthropisters,
who love me, thay say, and who wonder whi i don’t write
sum longer things. Awl I kan say tew them iz, that a short
bilt writer iz often dull enuff, and a long bilt one iz necessisarily
so. A streak ov lazy lightning, a mile long, that anyboddy
kan dodge, soon loozes awl its novelty.</p>

<p>Thare iz grate power in words, if yu don’t hitch tew menny
ov them together; but their only power iz the interpretashun
ov ideas; and the more ginger you kan git intu the pod the
better the dose.</p>

<p>Sum men are never so brilliant as when they don’t make
enny remarks, and no man needn’t git mad at himself bekauze
he haz sed a good thing without wasting a word.</p>

<p>A comik essayer haz got tew have a sprinkling ov the
monkey in him; he must akt sensible things strangely; it iz
not an eazy task tew be a good monkey, nor will it exackly
answer tew be an artyfishall monkey; the deviltry in a monkey
iz natral—if it want, it wouldn’t be funny, but ridikilous.</p>

<p>Az i hav sed on a feuter occasion before, it iz eazier tew be
a good critick, than a poor writer, but i am the last man tew
giv enny man mutch credit, for being able tew find fault.</p>

<p>If enny ov yure readers, Dear Mr. —— —— ——, or enny
ov the fust klass philanthropisters or philanthropisterisses, hav
got anny spare kapital lieing idle, they would like tew insert into
the comik essa bizness, i am reddy tew sell out mi small stock,
good will and fixtures, and i will quietly go into the frogs hind
<span id="pg_440" class="page_anchor">440 </span>
legg trade, and at the end ov 90 days, if they don’t find the
silver-plated nonsense bizzness harder tew steer than they
think it iz, i will giv them credit for having a good stock ov
brains or impudense, i don’t know whitch.</p>

<p>A man who iz on a jurney, iz expekted tew go slow, and
git dull, but if he iz on an errand he iz expekted tew be lively,
it iz jistly thus with yure long and yure cluss bilt writers.</p>

<p>I hope thoze who take the pain tew read this squiblet, will
giv me credit for writing what i think, if it ain’t so sarching
and brilliant, and i would thank thoze who semioftenly
advice me tew pump more power and doxology into what
i write, tew purchase me out and sett up the hot paragraff
trade theirselfs, and giv us wit on the haff-shell, nitroglycerine
humor, fun soaked in kamphene, jests crazy tew go oph at
haff cock, and raw sense that will make a saw-hoss laff.</p>

<p>I am mad that i ever set sail in the comik essa schooner,
tew be so often caught on the flats, and if i could git out of it
now and hav enny karakter at all left i would grab at the
offer.</p>

<p>I will stop bi saying that it iz a darn sight eazier tew write
too mutch than it iz too little, and awl comik attempts, must
be quick tew win, for folks wont bear but little phooling at
once on enny subjik, and i say bully for you, folks.</p>

<h2 id="sec-186">FEMALE REMARKS.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">D</span>ear</span> Girls, are yu in sarch ov a husband?</p>

<p>This is a pumper, and y u are not required tew say “Yes”
out loud, but are expekted tew throw yure eyes down onto
the earth, az tho yu waz looking for a pin, and reply tew the
interrogatory, with a kind ov draud-in sigh, az tho yu waz
eating an oyster, juice and all, off from the half shell.</p>

<p>Not tew press so tender a theme untill it bekums a thorn
in the flesh, we will presume (tew avoid argument) that yu
are on the look-out for sumthing in the male line tew boost
yu in the up-hill ov life, and tew keep hiz eye on the britching
when yu begin tew go down the other side of the mountain.
Let me give yu sum small chunks ov advice how tew spot
yure fewter hussband:</p>

<p>1. The man who iz jellous ov every little attenshun which
yu git from sum other fellow, yu will find, after yu are married
tu him, luvs himself more than he duz yu, and what yu
mistook for solissitude, yu will diskover, has changed into
indifference. Jellousy isn’t a heart-diseaze; it is a liver-komplaint.</p>

<p>2. A mustash is not indispensible; it iz only a little more
hair, and iz a good deal like moss and other excressences—often
duz the best on sile that won’t raize ennything else.
Don’t forgit that thoze things which yu admire in a phellow
before marriage, yu will probably hav tew admire in a hussband
after, and a mustash will git tew be very weak diet after
a long time.</p>

<p>3. If hussbands could be took on trial, az irish-cooks are,
two-thirds ov them would probably be returned; but thare
don’t seem tew be enny law for this. Tharefore, girls, yu will
see that after yu git a man, yu hav got tew keep him, even
if yu loose on him. Consequently, if yu hav got enny kold
vitles in the house, try him on them, once in a while, during
courting season, and if he swallers them well, and sez he will
take sum more, he is a man who, when blue Monday cums
will wash well.</p>

<span id="pg_446" class="page_anchor">446 </span>

<p>4. Don’t marry a pheller who iz alwus a-telling how hiz
mother duz things. It iz az hard tew suit these men as it iz
tew wean a yung one.</p>

<p>5. If a yung man kan beat yu playing on a pianner, and
kant hear a fish-horn playing in the street without turning a
back summersett on account ov the musick that iz in him, i
say, skip him; he might answer tew tend babe, but if yu sett
him tew hoeing out the garden, yu will find that yu hav got
tew do it yureself. A man whoze whole heft lies in musick
(and not very hefty at that), ain’t no better for a husband
than a seedlitz powder; but if he luvs tew listen while yu sing
sum gentle ballad, yu will find him mellow, and not soft.
But don’t marry enny boddy for jist one virtew enny quicker
than yu would flop a man for jist one fault.</p>

<p>6. It iz one of the most tuffest things for a female tew be
an old maid successfully. A great menny haz tried it, and
made a bad job ov it. Evryboddy seems tew look upon old
maids jist az they do upon dried harbs—in the garret, handy
for sickness—and, tharefore, girls, it aint a mistake that yu
should be willing tew swop yurself oph, with some true
phellow, for a hussband. The swop iz a good one; but don’t
swop for enny man who iz respektabel jist bekause his father
iz. You had better be an old maid for 4 thousand years, and
then join the Shakers, than tew buy repentance at this price.
No woman ever made this trade who didn’t git either a
phool, a mean cuss, or a clown for a hussband.</p>

<p>7. In digging down into his subject, i find the digging
grows harder the further i git. It iz mutch easier tew inform
yu who not tew marry, than who tew, for the reason thare iz
more ov them.</p>

<p>I don’t think yu will foller mi advise, if i giv it; and,
tharefore, i will keep it; for i look upon advise as i do upon
castor ile—a mean dose tew giv, and a mean dose tew take.</p>

<p>But i must say one thing, girls, or spile. If you kan find
a bright-eyed, healthy, and well-ballasted boy, who looks upon
poverty az sassy az a child looks upon wealth—who had
rather sit down on the curb-stun, in front ov the 5th avenue
<span id="pg_447" class="page_anchor">447 </span>
hotel, and eat a ham sandwitch, than tew go inside, and run in
debt for hiz dinner and toothpick—one who iz armed with
that kind ov pluck, that mistakes a defeat for a victory, mi
advise is tew take him boddy and soul—snare him at onst,
for he iz a stray trout, or a breed very skase in our waters.</p>

<p>Take him i say, and bild onto him, az hornets bild on to a
tree.</p>

<h4>A SUGGESTSHUN.</h4>

<p>The morning paper iz just az necessary for an Amerikan
az dew iz to the grass.</p>

<p>Hot kakes and kaughphy, kodphish bawls, and hash are useful,
but the morning paper iz vittles and drink.</p>

<p>An Amerikan who haz not red the morning nuze iz not
more than haff edukated for that day; he goes tew hiz bizzness
haff-doubtful and haff-ashamed ov himself; he iz
afrade tew look hiz nabor in the face, and ackts az ignorant az
a man in a strange land who don’t understand the language.</p>

<p>Every man he meets thru the day tells him sumthing nu,
and when he goze home at nite he iz az silent and misterious
tew the wife ov hiz buzzum az tho he had lost sumthing.</p>

<span id="pg_451" class="page_anchor">451 </span>

<p>There iz lots ov pholks who git all their larning out ov the
morning papers, and when they hav 2 collums ov it laid in
they are az phatt with usephull knowledge az the sekretary
ov a sowing sosiety.</p>

<p>They go round az glib az a boy’s windmill in a good
breeze; they ain’t afraid to button-hole ennybody and talk
incessintly tew the boy on the korner while he shines up hiz
shuze.</p>

<p>The man who hain’t red the morning paper, and the man
who haz, are about alike uneazy tew encounter. The one
who haint, iz az kross az a dog who haint got enny bone, and
the other phellow iz az stiff in the back az the dog who haz
got two.</p>

<p>I luv miself tew read the morning paper, and i also luv tew
go onst in a while away over on the other side ov the mountain,
whare thare aint enny morning paper, and set down,
and feel ignorant all day. It iz like turning an old hoss out
tew grass, and gitting the oats all out ov him.</p>

<p>This ceaseless hankering after nuze iz a good way tew forgit
life, but iz not the best way tew enjoy it. It iz often only a
mania, and it iz quite az often the kase that what a man learns
in this way to day, he phinds out tomorrow aint so.</p>

<p>But an Amerikan kant git along without hiz morning
paper. Red hot nuze iz just as necessary tew him tew begin
the day with az sider brandy fresh from the still iz to an old
toper.</p>

<h2 id="sec-188">ON COURTING.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">C</span>ourting</span> is a luxury, it is sallad, it is ise water, it is a
beveridge, it is the pla spell ov the soul.</p>

<p>The man who has never courted haz lived in vain; he haz
bin a blind man amung landskapes and waterskapes; he has
bin a deff man in the land ov hand orgins, and by the side ov
murmuring canals.</p>

<span id="pg_452" class="page_anchor">452 </span>

<p>Courting iz like 2 little springs ov soft water that steal out
from under a rock at the fut ov a mountain and run down
the hill side by side singing and dansing and spatering each
uther, eddying and frothing and kaskading, now hiding under
bank, now full ov sun and now full ov shadder, till bimeby
tha jine and then tha go slow.</p>

<p>I am in faver ov long courting; it gives the parties a chance
to find out each uther’s trump kards, it iz good exercise, and
is jist as innersent as 2 merino lambs.</p>

<p>Courting iz like strawberries and cream, wants tew be did
slow, then yu git the flaver.</p>

<p>Az a ginral thing i wouldn’t brag on uther gals mutch when
i waz courting, it mite look az tho yu knu tew mutch.</p>

<p>If yu will court 3 years in this wa, awl the time on the square
if yu don’t sa it iz a leettle the slikest time in yure life, yu kan
git measured for a hat at my expense, and pa for it.</p>

<p>Don’t court for munny, nor buty, nor relashuns, theze things
are jist about az onsartin as the kerosene ile refining bissness,
liabel tew git out ov repair and bust at enny minnit.</p>

<p>Court a gal for fun, for the luv yu bear her, for the vartue
and bissness thare is in her; court her for a wife and for a
mother, court her as yu wud court a farm—for the strength
ov the sile and the parfeckshun ov the title; court her as tho
she want a fule, and yu a nuther; court her in the kitchen, in
the parlor, over the wash-tub, and at the pianner; court this
wa, yung man, and if yu don’t git a good wife and she don’t
git a good hustband, the falt won’t be in the courting.</p>

<p>Yung man, yu kan rely upon Josh Billings, and if yu kant
make these rules wurk jist send for him and he will sho yu
how the thing is did, and it shant kost yu a cent.</p>

<h2 id="sec-190">JOSH MOUNTS A VELOCIPEDE.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">T</span>he</span> velosipead iz a wize instrumentality, with two wheels,
placed consekutively, one wheel before the other, and the
other wheel behind the fust one.</p>

<p>They revolve on their axes, simular to the world, from
east to west, and have already reached the shores of the Pacifick
oshun.</p>

<p>They are az eazy tew ride, az a grind stun.</p>

<p>They will undoubtedly do away with the use of steam, and
in fifty years from now, will be the only means of lokomoshun,
known to man.</p>

<p>The ladies will all use them, jist az soon az they kan settle
the question, in what manner they shall occupy them.</p>

<p>Just now there iz a dispute, whether they shall occupy
both sides ov the velosipead at once, or whether they shall
remain on one side ov them at once, similar to the anshunt
custom ov occupying the noble animal, the hoss.</p>

<p>It iz to be hoped, that this matter will be laid before the
“wimmins’ right committee,” and that nothing, ov a one
sided natur, should be allowed tew hinder a woman from filling
her destiny.</p>

<p>I beleaf in throwing every thing wide open, to a fair competishun
between the two sexes, velosipeads, az well az medisin,
<i>and may the best man win</i>.</p>

<p>It might look a little odd (for the fust day or two) to see
<span id="pg_457" class="page_anchor">457 </span>
the ladies divided by a velosipead, but in the grate advance
ov prices, and morals, which are now at work in the world,
nobody but a darn phool, or a foggy, would object tew it—if
we are ever to reach perfeckshun in this world, we hav all ov
us got to hav a fair chance, at both sides ov things.</p>

<p>I hav examined the scientifick principles ov the velosipead,
and find that it iz just az simple az bread and milk.</p>

<p>The rotary cohesiveness which exists in all circumlocutory
gravitations, ackting in conjunction with the simple law ov
attraction, preserves the moshun ov the velosipead within its
proper and natural revolushun.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more simple and yet more beautiful than
this law in science; the philosophers are az well acquainted
with it az they are with the 10 commandments, and perhaps
better.</p>

<p>There iz one improvement in the velosipead which I am
looking anxiously forward to, and that iz, to learn to stand
still till you mount them.</p>

<p>Nothing iz more anoying than a habit they have got into
ov lying down on their sides, if yu undertake to endorse one
of them standing still.</p>

<p>I hav seen the nobel animal, the hoss, when they wanted
to git rid ov their rider, lay down sideways and roll over, and
kick up their heels. This iz a trick which the velosipead haz
stole from the hoss without giving him credit for it.</p>

<p>If mi memory serves me right, the moshun ov the velosipead
iz purely a crank moshun, simular tew the grind stun,
and iz produced the same way, that the scizzor grinder stirs
up his masheen.</p>

<p>I hav thought if the pioneer wheel of the velosipead could
be made out of whetestones, it might be used while in progress,
for sharpening razors, and carving knives, and thus bekum a
means ov grace, az well az buty, but this would take the poetry
all out ov it, and degrade it down to the level ov usefulness.</p>

<p>If you want tew take the starch out ov a novelty, just set
it to work at sumthing useful, it bekums inelegant to onst.</p>

<span id="pg_458" class="page_anchor">458 </span>

<p>The moshun ov the velosipead iz produced bi the action ov
the leggs—or rather, the action ov the pedal extremetys, the
word <i>leggs</i> iz altogether too obscene for every man to use, who
ever expekts tew run for the legislatur, or be caught in the
sosiety ov refined people.</p>

<p>This fakt iz sufficiently explained tew the latin skollar, who
understands that “velosipeads” iz manufakterd out ov two
forrin words, “<i>veloss</i>” and “<i>pedoss</i>,” which vulgarily means
“<i>lively leggs</i>,” but politely means, “<i>pedal swiftness</i>.”</p>

<p>If a man don’t understand latin now a daze, he kant hardly
enjoy the conversashun ov a hod carrier.</p>

<p>The velosipead iz not a modern discovery; long before the
days of Adam, and Eve, they waz in use.</p>

<p>The heathen gods had them, with one wheel to them, and
history tells us ov a grate expert, one Ixion, who got onto
the side ov one ov them, and traveled all over the Olympian
country.</p>

<p>I hav seen them miself with only one wheel to them, theze
had two handles, which protruded out behind, and were propelled
by a shove moshun.</p>

<p>Theze were fust discovered in Ireland, and I think are
called “wheelbarrows,” or sumthing that sounds like that.</p>

<p>This is all i kno now about the velosipeads.</p>

<h2 id="sec-191">THE RASE KOARSE.</h2>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">G</span>rate</span> rase! at Sulphur Flat trotting Park, on Thursda,
April 9th, for a puss ov 13 dollars, and a bulls-eye watch,
free for awl hosses, mares, geldings, mules, and Jackasses!</p>

<p>Seeing the above anounsement, pasted up on a gide board,
at “Jamaka rum four corners,” and having never saw a hoss
trot, on a well regulated rase koarse, for the improvement ov
the breed ov hosses, i agreed i wud go, jist tew encourage the
breeding ov good hosses.</p>

<p>I found the village of Sulphur Flats located in a lot and
well watered bi a griss-mill and 2 tannerys.</p>

<span id="pg_459" class="page_anchor">459 </span>

<p>The prinsipal buildings seem tu consiss ov a tavern stand,
3 groserys, an insurance offiss, and anuther tavern stand, awl
condukted on strik whiskee prinsiples.</p>

<p>I found the inhabitants a good deal tired in their religus
views and i thought the opening wud admit 3 or 4 missionarys
abreast.</p>

<p>The moste prinsipal bizness ov the peopil waz pealing bark
in the winter, and pitchin cents az soon az warm wether sot
in.</p>

<p>I asked a gentleman present, who ced he was a reporter for
“The Yung Man’s Christian Gide,” if he knew what the poplashun
ov the place definitely waz, and ced he definitely didn’t,
but if i would set out a pail ov whiskee, with a dipper into it,
on the top ov a hemlock stump, that grew in front ov the tavern,
it wouldn’t be 60 minnits befour i cud count the whole
ov them, and then we both ov us smiled, az it were, tew
onst.</p>

<p>Having asked sum uther inquirys, ov a mixed natur, i santered
down tu where the rase koarse waz.</p>

<span id="pg_460" class="page_anchor">460 </span>

<h3 id="sec-191-1">THE TRACK.</h3>

<p>I found the track waz about a mild in circumferense, and
ov a sandy disposishun, fensed in by a kranbury mash on one
side, and a brush fense on tuther, and in jist about 3 minnet
condishun.</p>

<p>The judge’s stand waz an ox cart surrounded on the sides
bi a ha rigging, and the reporters waz invited tew git intu the
cart.</p>

<h3 id="sec-191-2">THE HOSSES.</h3>

<p>Waz a gra mare, about the usual stature, not verry fat, and
laboring under a spring halt, which tha ced she had caught
ov anuther hoss, about 10 days ago.</p>

<p>Tha ced she had trotted tu a kamp-meeting last fall inside
ov a verry short time, and that her back bone waz awl game.</p>

<p>I asked a yung man with long yeller hair and bedtick pantyloons
on, who waz currying oph the mare, what her pedigree
was, and he with a wink tew anuther feller who stood clus bi,
ced, “she waz got bi the Landlord out ov a Methdiss minister,”
and then tha both laffed.</p>

<p>I found out bi inquirin, that her name waz “Fryin-Pan.”</p>

<p>The uther hoss waz a red hoss, rather hastily konstructed,
with a spare tale on him, which tha ced waz kaused by his
trotting so fast, in a windy day; i shud think he waz about
5 feet and a haf in hite, and ov a kickin natur.</p>

<p>Tha ced he waz a stranger in theze parts, and that his rite
name waz “Juise Harp.”</p>

<h3 id="sec-191-3">FUST HEAT.</h3>

<p>The hosses both cum up tew the skore in the immejiate
visinity ov each uther, and got the wurd tew go, the fust time.</p>

<p>The gra mare waz druv bi “Dave Larkin,” and the hoss
was handled bi “Ligh Turner.”</p>

<p>Tha trotted sublimely, az cluss az the Siamese twins; the
mare with her hed hi up and her noze full ov winde; the hoss
waz stretched out tite, like a chalk line; tha passed the haf
mile pole simultaneously, time, 2 minnits.</p>

<p>Now the kontest becum exsiting, “Dave” hollered, and
<span id="pg_461" class="page_anchor">461 </span>
“Ligh” yelled—on tha kum, the mare gru higher, and the
hoss gru longer—tha make the last turn tew onst—tha look
like a dubble team—the exsitement grows more intensely—the
crowd sways to and fro—the ox cart trembles—tha cum!
tha cum! sich shouting, sich yelling, sich swearing, sich chawing
terbacker, waz never herd before; the mare iz ahed!—no,
the hoss iz ahed! ’tis even, ’tis a ded hete, tha pass the ox
kart—the hoss wins bi 3 quarters ov an inch, time 4 minnits
lacking 2 seckunds.</p>

<h3 id="sec-191-4">REMARKS.</h3>

<p>The hosses ar surrounded bi a crowd ov men, wimmin, and
children.</p>

<p>Each party are sanguinary ov suckces.</p>

<p>The bettin iz 2 quarts ov whiskee to anything, on the red
hoss.</p>

<p>At this junkture the gentleman, reporter for the Young
man’s Christian Gide, propozed tew bet 75 cents that the
mare wud win the nex heat; i tuk the proposishun forthwithly,
and the steaks, bi mutual consent, was placed in mi hat and
sot under the kart, and here let me stait, before i forget it,
that i haint saw the steaks nor the hat sinse.</p>

<h3 id="sec-191-5">SECKUND HEAT.</h3>

<p>The hosses both sho signs ov distress.</p>

<p>The gra mare’s ears hang down the side ov her hed, like
two wet rags, and the hoss rests his tale on the ground.</p>

<p>Tha go slola bak tew the distanse pole, and cum up agin
tew the skore, az tho tha waz yoked together.</p>

<p>Awa tha go; the hoss a leetle ahed.</p>

<p>The hoss leads tew the haf mild pole in 2:30.</p>

<p>On the bak stretch, “Dave” went at the mare with hiz
long purswader; she trots like litening, she passes the hoss!
no! she busts! she busts! and befour “Dave” cud flatten her
down tew her work, she broke from the trak and trotted clean
up tew her hips in the krambery mash.</p>

<p>The hoss cum in awl alone, trotting fast, and so clus down,
that 2 feet ov his tale dragged on the ground.</p>

<span id="pg_462" class="page_anchor">462 </span>

<p>Time ov this heat, not fur from 5 minnits, “Juise Harp”
winning, bi a quarter ov a mile.</p>

<p>Thus ended the grate rase at “Sulphur Flats.”</p>

<p>I immejiately started on foot for “Jamaka Rum four
corners,” bare headed, but fully impressed that, tho men, and
even whiskee mite deteryoate, the breed ov hosses must begin
tew improve in that seckshun ov the kuntry in a fu dais.</p>

<p><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">H</span>ere</span> we have a batch of immaculate truths from the
“Owl Club.”</p>

<p>After the minutes of the last meeting had been read and
approved, each “Owl,” as is their custom, lit his cigar, shook
out his feathers, and story-telling commenced, the President
leading off as usual.</p>

<p>“I never can hear of a man’s gitting his head broke,” said
the President, “but I call to mind the wonderful accident that
occured at Austin, Texas, twenty years ago.</p>

<p>“A man was thrown from his horse, while riding at full
speed into town, and striking against the sharp edge of a potash
kettle, which lay beside the road, his head was split down
to his collar-bone, each half hanging over his shoulders like a
pair ov epaulettes.</p>

<p>“This man was taken up for dead, but recovered, by skillful
treatment, and was elected county judge afterward on the
strength of this accident.”</p>

<p>“A very good story, and undoubtedly true,” said the Vice-President
“Owl,” “but I don’t think it quite so miraculous
as the different escapes that Joe French, a friend of mine, a
clerk on one of the Mississippi steamboats, has passed safely
through.</p>

<p>“His last adventure was on the high-pressure steamer Hurricane.</p>

<p>“As she was passing Natches, on a down trip, she blew up,
and filled the air with every kind of fragments.</p>

<p>“Joe was sent up about two hundred and fifty feet, and
<span id="pg_466" class="page_anchor">466 </span>
there being a strong wind at the time, he was carried over
onto the center of the city, and fell through the roof of a
jewelry store.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill-88">
<a href="images/ill-89.jpg"><img src="images/ill-89_min.jpg" alt="SPINNING YARNS"></a>
</div>

<p>“After passing down through three stories of the building,
he struck on his feet, by the side of the proprietor of the concern,
who demanded
five hundred dollars
for the damages done
to his building.</p>

<p>“‘I can’t pay so
much money,’ said
Joe, ‘but i will give
you two hundred
and fifty, <i>and I have
often settled for this
price before</i>.’”</p>

<p>“Bully for Joe
French,” said one of
the “Owls.” “But
let me tell you a
little story about an
attorney by the
name of Gersh’
Buckley, who practiced
law at Burlington, Iowa, a few years ago.</p>

<p>“Gersh had a case, in the county court, which he lost, and
in settling with his client was charged by the other attorney
with taking less than the customary fees.</p>

<p>“Gersh plead quietly to the charge. ‘But, gentlemen,’
said he, ‘<i>I done all in my power to sustain the honor of the
profession, I took all the money the man had</i>.’”</p>

<p>At this point, one of the “Owls,” more noted for his gravity
than any of the rest, mounted his perch, and begged to be
heard, as follows:</p>

<p>“Talking about steamboats reminds me of a circumstance
which occurred on the lower Mississippi, in the year 1840.
I had been down to New Orleans and was on my return, having
<span id="pg_467" class="page_anchor">467 </span>
taken passage on the fast side-wheel steamer, Fanny Birch.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five miles up the river we overtook the Memphis
Belle, an opposition boat, just leaving a woodyard. Rosin
and pine was soon the order ov exercises, and both boats were
quickly side by side in a close-contested race.</p>

<p>“Suddenly word was passed along the boat, ‘Man overboard!’</p>

<p>“The captain, rushing aft, inquired of the clerk if the man
had paid his passage.</p>

<p>“‘Yes!’ shouted the clerk.</p>

<p>“‘Then go ahead on her, engineer!’ was the captain’s order.”</p>

<p>“Owl” number five plumed his feathers and opened his
short but silvery-toned beak, as follows:</p>

<p>“Out in Nevada, during a race week, a rider was thrown
from a horse and taken up insensible. As he lay on a stretcher
near the judges’ stand many wagers were made among the
sporting fraternity present, upon his death or recovery.</p>

<p>“A surgeon present proposed to bleed the boy, but the
gamblers interposed, for, they said, it would seriously <i>affect
the fairness of the bets</i>.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that story,” said “Owl” Number Six:
“but here is one which has been in our family for over forty
years, and we all know it to be true:</p>

<p>“An old gentleman—who, by the way, was almost entirely
deaf, had brought a suit against one of his neighbors, claiming
certain damages. The case was one which the justice
thought ought not to go to a jury, but should be settled between
the parties. He therefore instructed the attorney to
ask the old gentleman what he would take to settle the suit.
The lawyer, putting his mouth near the deaf man’s ear, said,
in a loud tone:</p>

<p>“‘The court wants to know what you will take.’</p>

<p>“Turning his eye blandly toward the judge’s bench, the
old gentleman replied:</p>

<p>“‘Thank the squire for me, and tell him I will take a leetle
Santy Cruise rum without sugar.’”</p>

<span id="pg_468" class="page_anchor">468 </span>

<p>“Owl” Number Seven, looking uncommon wise, got off
the following:</p>

<p>“Two shad fishermen got into a dispute lately about a fish
net, which they both laid claim to, and, as the war of words
was reaching its hight, a son of one of the beligerents coming
upon the scene, cried out to his venerable parent:</p>

<p>“‘Old man, don’t let him git the start of you—<i>call him a
thief and a liar first</i>.’”</p>

<p>“That puts me in mind,” said the next “<i>Owl</i>,” of a story,
not at all similar, but more funny I think, than the one we
have just listened to.</p>

<p>“Over in Jersey, an honest old Dutchman, who followed
gardening for a living, had been to the neighboring town to
do a little trading at the stores, and having taken his wife with
him, both ov them got <i>unco</i> tight.</p>

<p>“On their way home the old woman fell, out of the wagon,
as they were crossing a salt meadow, and was not missed untill
the old gent reached home. The neighbors going back to
search for the missing wife, found her stuck fast in the mud
of the marsh, and talking in a maudlin manner, to the rising
tide which had risen up, and just began to play about her
lips. ‘<i>Not another drop, hot, nor cold; not another drop,
will I take.</i>’”</p>

Sue, she waz not alwus welkum, but no one turned her away,
a night’s lodgeing no one refused, she was even butiful still,
when i waz a boy, but i shrunk from the flash ov her misterious
eye.</p>

<p>The old folks knu her story, it waz that sad one, so often
told, and so soon forgotten, a mans perfidy.</p>

<p>Sue Dunham raves no more, but in the farther korner, just
<span id="pg_470" class="page_anchor">470 </span>
bak ov the little one story church, whare the ded lay the

<p>Parson Powell, who led hiz flok bi the side ov still waters
who wet with hallowed drops at christnings, who jined in

Job’s sons, and dauters.</p>

Larkins, 40 years ago, in a wrassle on the village green, and

<p>Ah, it iz pleasant!—it is sad, to go bak tew the village of

<p><i>Mister Brown.</i>—In haste, dear sur, I repli tew yure letter
thusly:</p>

<p>Jews harps are a one stringed instrument, held between
the teeth, blowed on gently, and tickled with the fore-finger.
The musik which they yield is balmy, but looses much of
its melloness unless played upon bi a bull frog. I hav listened
for hours at a bull frog playing on a Jews harp, and
wept like a child. This iz the kind a musik that enters mi
soul like a sister ov charity out ov a job. I hav a yung female
bull frog now in mi employ, who plays the Jews harp quite
bully for one ov her sex. Sum people must hav opera musik
or they aint helthy, but giv me the liquid Jews harp, tickled
bi the yung and impashioned bull frog.</p>

<p>If i waz ritch i would buy me two akers ov swamp ground,
issue proposals for a millyun ov Jews harps, and set every
bull frog on mi farm to instrumental musik.</p>

<p>Thare are others who aint happy unless they kan hear the
pensiv murmers ov the bass drum, or the hoarse gutteral ov
the trombone, or the pig like laffing ov the fife, or the jigger
ov the banjo and the bones.</p>

<p>I hav nothing but pitty for sich depraved tasted critters,
and look forward, with the joyful gush ov a missionary, to
the time when bull frogs will set under every vine and fig
tree, tickling the buzzom ov a Jews harp.</p>

<p>If i kan hav plenty ov Jews harps, and a bull frog, i dont
kare if i dont never hear a hand orgin agin.</p>

<p><i>Mister Bates.</i>—The best kind ov bate for a rat, iz toasted
cheeze, and the best kind ov a trap, iz the one, that will ketch
them the oftenest, and hang onto them the most. It aint always
a sure thing tew ketch a rat bi the tail, i hav knew
them tew bight oph
their tail, just outside
ov the jaws ov the
trap, and thus save
their rat meat.</p>

<p>Bob tailed rats hav
ceased tew be a curiosity
to me long ago.</p>

<p>Once i should hav
looked upon a bob-tailed
rat with mingled
pheelings ov pitty,
and suprise, but them
daze hav fled from
me, i look upon a bob-tailed
rat now, as a
cluss bizzness transackshun.</p>

<p>Rats are one ov the
far-famed butys ov civilashun, they wont live in the wildernes,
and i wouldn’t if i waz they.</p>

<p>Sum folks are so enlightened they kant bear rats, but az i
lay in mi bed, at mi boarding hous, at the deceased hours ov
night, it iz one ov mi priviliges, tew hear the rats chawing
holes throu the base boards, and playing tag in the wainscote.</p>

<p>Rats are very prolifick, one pair ov assorted rats, will keep
a phamily in rats for years.</p>

<p>Rats are very easy tew keep, thare aint but phew things but
what they will eat, and them phew things are locked up.</p>

<p>Rats are not a subjekt ov diet in this country, but i am
told bi missionarys, that rat pi, iz thick in China.</p>

<p>I shouldn’t wonder if rat pi might be good, but i hav alwus
accustomed mi self to plain vittles.</p>

<span id="pg_474" class="page_anchor">474 </span>

<p><i>Mister Barnes.</i>—Hash iz made out ov cast oph vittles.</p>

<p>Hash haz done more for the human race ov man than almost
enny other breed ov food.</p>

<p>For breakfast, a small tender-lion steak, sum few ham &amp;
eggs, 3 baked potatoze, a plate of buttered toast, sum slap
jacks, 2 cups of coffy, and sum hash iz good.</p>

<p>I like to eat hash this way better than enny other.</p>

<p>Sum pholks alwuz raize their noze up at hash.</p>

<p>If yu search history, with one eye, yu will find theze folks,
20, or 30 years ago, more or less, were born on hash.</p>

<p>I hav seen hash miself, that i had mi doubts about, but i et
it, and still liv.</p>

<p>I love hash as a principle, and this iz mi rule, i watch the
landlady, and if she eats it, i take the sekond plate.</p>

<p>This makes me very popular at all the boarding houses
which I attend.</p>

<p>If folks would be a leetle more penurious with their hash,
and not git stubs ov tallo kandles, babys morocko shoes, and
now and then a fine tooth comb, that want more than half
worn out, into their hash, hash would stand to day, at the
head of all mux food.</p>

<p><i>Mister Bartlett.</i>—Ov all the animals who waz brought
akrost the waters, into this country, by that grate improver
ov the breed ov kattle Noah, i consider the cow the most
respektable.</p>

<p>A cow iz a kind ov old aunt in the family.</p>

<p>I dont kno ov a more honest, and salubrious sight, than a
brindle cow, that wont kik, and who gives 10 quarts ov milk
that aint watered.</p>

<p>It iz unkommon hard to git a cow to giv milk that aint
watered now daze, thare iz a grate difference in cows about
this.</p>

<p>It iz sed the cowcumber derives its name from the cow,
but whether this iz so, or not, i kant find out.</p>

<p>Probably it iz, becauze they resemble the cow so mutch.</p>

<p>The cowcumber cums under the hed ov gardin sass, and
they gro on a running vine, and the vine kan beat every vine
running, for 100 yards, in Amerika, after it gits started.</p>

<span id="pg_475" class="page_anchor">475 </span>

<p>They are a little balky about starting.</p>

<p>I hav known a cowcumber vine to run 15 foot in one night
besides giving birth to 7 young cowcumbers on the way.</p>

<p>Kowcumbers kut up into thin slices, and rooled in peper,
and psalt, and soaked in vinegar, are good, for a sharp pain
in the hebdominal region.</p>

<p>A cowcumber iz about the only thing that i kan remember
ov now, that iz good for nothing, after it reaches perfektshun.</p>

three years ago.</p>

<p>I found him ded in a vakant lot, near mi house.</p>

from a clothes line, or worry a goose, most butiful tew behold.</p>

<p>He waz a bul pup, but iz no more.</p>

</div>

<p>If i had a boy now who had enny simptoms ov enny kind
ov lawless, unfixed, and flux noshuns, and who didn’t seem
tew kare whether he ever amounted tew enny thing or not,
and who couldn’t tell whare he waz last night till half past
two this Morning, and
who couldn’t recognize
hiz own washer-woman,
and who wanted tew go
into bizzness fur himself,
at 16 years old,
with a kapital ov two
bottles ov Phalon’s extrakt,
and a mustash,
that resembled the mold
on a pound ov limeberger
cheese, I would
say confidenshally tu
him:</p>

<p>“<i>Son</i>, i hav ben tew
blame thus far in frameing
yure timber, but yu
kan bet them pattent
leather boots yu hav got
on, and witch haint bin paid for yet, that from now hereafter
yu hav got tew begin agin, and weed out yure gardin sass, and
sucker yure grape vine, and plough up yure wild oats, and
underdrain yure swamp land, and bush hook yure briar patch
and fix yure farm for a krop ov sum kind ov grain that will
not disgrace both son and daddy, when it iz brought tew
market.”</p>

<p>This iz the way i would converse with the young Billings,
and if he didn’t begin, in ten minnitts, tew take an akount ov
hiz bad dets, but begin tew argy the pint with me, and ackt
yung rooster up and down in front ov me, mi strong impreshun
iz now, that i would retreat a step and let fly mi left purswader,
and land that boy sum 60 feet futher oph than he waz.</p>

<span id="pg_479" class="page_anchor">479 </span>

<p>It would hav bin six hundred dollars in mi vest pocket if
sum philanthropisst, about thirty years ago, had got mi knob
in chancery, and not given up the case till he had punched
out ov my hed the fresh water noshun that the best way tew
foller a blind trail in the wilderness waz not tew take enny
compass.</p>

<p>This kind ov ded sure knowledge, amung fresh yung men,
haz landed four hundred out ov evry five hundred ov them,
before they had got half way thru life, into sum soft swamp,
and the other hundred hav sot out the close ov their lifes on
a fence, lamenting the hard work they did, in their younger
daze, tew make * * * phools ov themselfs.</p>

<p>I kno it iz az eazy az chawing gum, for a yung instutution ov
a boy, who haz got a burning-fluid natur, tew be anxious tew
jine all the torch-lite doings in the country, and tew holler
“amen” before the prayer iz haff through; but i feel it my
duty tew tell these camphene children tew cork up their litening.</p>

<p>I don’t want enny body’s boy Billy tew be a ded hed; a
skim-milk cheeze; a colporter of water gruel; a putty babeling;
a kurl-papered nussery doll; an apron-tied anatomy
blonde; a timid corpse amung hiz phellows, afraid ov a bug,
and satisfied with a kitten.</p>

<p>I ain’t voting for this breed ov boys; i only ask the virginity
ov mi sex tew make up their minds, from the experiences
ov those who have observed the elaphant, that youth waz
given them, not tew be boss, but apprentiss; not tew lead, but
tew foller; not tew harvest, but tew plant.</p>

<p>There iz no danger in turning a snaik loose; even before
he gits fairly haired out, natur teaches him tew make his fust
wiggle a correct pattern for hiz last one. She makes him a
snaik from the word “go,” and nothing else, and if he takes
a noshun tew go tew the devil—who cares?</p>

<p>But ov all the most deplorabel luck that kan be the inheritance
ov a camphene boy, i don’t kno ov a more dangerous
one than tew be hiz own master, or the master ov hiz daddy.</p>

<p>I hav known sum ov theze excentricks that Satan couldn’t
<span id="pg_480" class="page_anchor">480 </span>
ketch, who hav dodged him suckcessfully for the whole ov
their lives, but i kan tell you, mi dear boys, it is no credit tew
match yourselfs against the devil, even if you hav a ded soft
thing. This beating the devil at his own game, is like surviving
the small pox, it may make yu proff agin sum more small
pox, but yu are sure tew show sum ov the dents.</p>

<p>Dear Brigham, theze remarks are not intended tew be personal,

<p><span class="smallcaps"><span class="first_word"><span class="cap">M</span>i</span> Dear Miss Jemima Josephine Jenkins</span>:</p>

<p>I received your kind letter on time, asking me tew
impart mi influence tew prokure for yu the privilege (and sundry
and divers other females in yure school deestrikt) tew
vote, and hav offis, and do the same things that men do.</p>

<div class="illustration full" id="ill-92">
<a href="images/ill-93.jpg"><img src="images/ill-93_min.jpg" alt=""></a>
</div>

<p>I hav thought over the thing industriously, and should be
happy to floor miself, and all mi energys at yure feet in enny
cauze that i thought waz for your happiness and final suckcess.</p>

<span id="pg_484" class="page_anchor">484 </span>

<p>I am in favour ov wimmin, and they kan own me at enny
moment bi asking for me or dropping me a letter.</p>

<p>I owe them mi existence, mi fust nourishment, and mi fust
virtews.</p>

<p>If i am ever saved it will be the result ov woman’s care and
influence, at a time when i want worth saving.</p>

<p>Woman haz dun for me what no man could or would do.</p>

<p>But, Jemima, Eve, yure gratist grandmother, committed a
mistake, a good deal bigger than the one which yu are anxious
tew commit, but thare iz a remote similarity in the mistakes.</p>

<p>She wanted tew kno and hav a hand in awl that waz a going
on, and the Devil offered tew teach her, and yu hav heard
what the result waz.</p>

<p>Mi advise tew yu iz tew stay right whare yu are, yu hav a
power now that never kan be less if yu hold on to it, but if
yu spit on yure hands tew git a better holt yu may lose yure
grip entirely.</p>

<p>When yu begin tew vote yu hav got tew learn how tew
wrangle, tew jaw back, tew intrigue, and bet yure stamps on
the election, and if yu vote contrary tew yure husband thare
will be a muss in the family, and if he votes kontrary tew yu
there will be a bigger muss in the family.</p>

<p>Voting iz a mere negatiff power ennyhow. If a vote aint
hove right it iz wuss than no vote, and what assurance hav yu
tew offer that yu are going tew vote right? Yu hav more
sensitiveness than the men have, and konsequently more
prejudices, yu hav got full az mutch vanity and a heap more
stubborness.</p>

<p>Thare iz more than haff the votes hove now without judgement
or influenced bi others.</p>

<p>If yu git hold ov the ballot box what reformashuns dew yu
propose?</p>

<p>I hav never saw yure platform.</p>

<p>Yu will vote against whiskee, i hope, and tobbacco, and
whiskers, and club rooms, and trotting hosses, and pitching
cents, and staying out late nights, and wearing pattent leather
boots, two sizes too small, and lots ov this kind ov male iniquity,
but what are yu going tu vote <i>for</i>?</p>

<span id="pg_485" class="page_anchor">485 </span>

<p>Yu will hav tew vote agin trials bi jury, and dispoze ov
them or else yu will hav tew sit on jurys, and will this be
yure best style?—eight men and four wimmin locked up in
a jury room all night together, on bred and water, with yure
husbands peeking thru the key holes, tew see how the verdik
is a going.</p>

<p>Yu will hav tew vote agin a poll tax, and git rid ov poll
taxes, or, if yu are poor, yu will hav tew work yure tax out on the
road, alongside ov sum rum drinking and tobbaco chawing
wretch, who will take grate pains tew chaw, and sware, tew
show hiz superiorite tew yu.</p>

<p>Yu will hav tew vote agin all riots, and reserexkshuns, and
thus put an end tew them, or else when thare iz an irish riot,
to kill oph the surpluss niggers, yu will hav tew cum out armed
with sumthing, if nothing more than a pair ov tongs, and just
az like az not looze yure best waterfall in the mussness, jist
think how billyous this will be.</p>

<p>Yu will hav tew vote agin awl kind ov housework, for how
kan yu run the United States government, if yu are kept
patching pantaloons all the time?</p>

<p>Yu will hav tew vote agin enny more human beings making
their appearance, for who iz a going tew nourish the babe,
while yu are down tew the town hall, trieing tew elekt a favourite
constabel, yure husband kant do it enny how, unless yu
hav him rekonstrukted.</p>

<p>Suppoze yu git elekted tew congress from yure distrikt,
every woman in the country, who haz got a husband thare,
will be on hand tew watch how things are a going, and yu
will be acused ov transgreshuns, that never entered yure hed,
or hart.</p>

<p>Suppoze yu had a vote to day, dew yu know of enny
woman on arth, that yu would vote for, i mean, unmarried
woman, like yureself?</p>

<p>Miss Jemima, Josephine, Jenkins, the more i grind these
things in mi mind, the more i think yu had better turn yure
attenshun towards harvesting a good hustband, and making
his house the envy ov the naberhood, bi the gentle, and
<span id="pg_486" class="page_anchor">486 </span>
domestik virtews, which Heaven haz so lavishly loaned tew
yu, rather than attending caucusses, holding wimmin convenshuns,
or travelling athwart the country, in company with a
set of longhaired, male hybrids, who haven’t got enny reputashun
tew spare, and who will cheat yu out ov what yu hav
got.</p>

<p>If you or enny other virtewous, gentle woman, wants an
ernest defender, one who beleaves that yure sex holds the
ballance ov power now, one who looks upon a mother (who
ever she iz) az the queen ov the situation, one who looks upon
a sister az an angel friend, one who looks upon a daughter az
the gift of God, one who looks upon a wife with awl the
pathos of venerashun, if yu want any help from sich a pheller,
in battling with the trials that Heaven haz planted in the
pathway ov a womans legitimate sphear, send for me, i am
yure man.</p>

<p>But i hav no ambishun tew see yu a voter, and i think the
hour which sees yure sex, in this country, voters, will see the
eazy and rapid dissolushun ov the only barrier we have,
between the coarse instinkts ov man, and the sakred safety ov
the domestick vertews, ov which yu hav been ordained the
vestal keepers.</p>

<p>Pardon me, Miss Jemima, if mi language in this letter iz
strong, it cums from a strong place, mi heart, if i didn’t mean
what i say i should hav bin az sweet az a courtier, i should
hav torked about the gorgeous mission of woman, the exalted
career that might be opened for her in walks yet untrod, and
other rhapsodys in the key bugle style, but i kno the power
that woman haz over me, and i kno whare it lays, it dont lay
in the ballot box, it lays in that misterious delikasy ov hers,
thoze silken threads, whoze power iz invisible.</p>

<p>In summing up, if i kno ennything about human natur all
that “<i>Wimmin’s rights</i>” means, iz, <i>more power</i>, and enny
woman who would exchange a single article, in the “magna-karta”
which she now iz empress ov, for the whole ov the
byelaws, constitushun, and power sought for, in the ranting
programme ov a “wimmins right convenshun,” would be
swapping an intrinsick bower, for an emaskulated privilege.</p>

<p>“<i>Snyder.</i>”—Rats originally cum from Norway, and i wish
they had originally
staid thare.
They are about
as uncalled for as
a pain in the
small ov the
back. They kan
be domestikated
dreadful eazy,
that is, as far as
gitting in cupboards,
and eating
cheese, and
knawing pie, is
concerned.</p>

<p>The best way
tew domestikate
them that ever I saw, is tew surround them gently, with a
steel trap; yu kan reason with them then tew grate advantage.</p>

<p>Rats are migratorious, they migrately whare ever they hav
a mind to.</p>

<p>Pisen is also good for rats; it softens their whole moral
naturs.</p>

<p>Cats hate rats, and rats hate cats, and—who don’t.</p>

<p>I serpose thare is between 50 and 60 millions of rats in
Amerika (i quote now entirely from memory,) and i don’t
serpose thare is a single necessary rat in the whole lot. This
shows at a glance how menny waste rats thare is. Rats enhance
in numbers, faster than shoe pegs do by machinery. One
pair ov helthy rats is awl that enny man wants tew start the
rat bissiness with, and in ninety days, without enny outlay,
he will begin tew hav rats,—tew turn oph.</p>

a near and very dear friend our ortograff a few years

hoss, but yu ought tew take it kind, looking down hill, with
an expreshun, about half tickled and half scart. After the
pop iz over, if your luvver wants tew kiss you, I dont think
I would say yes or no, but let the thing kind ov take its own
course.</p>

<p><i>Mirakle</i>:—Yu sa “yu kant understand the mirakle ov the
whale, that swallered Joner.” I dont serpose that Joner, nor
the whale, ever fully understood it themselfs. I kant tell yu
what Joner did while in the whale’s sosiety; but i kno what
a yankee would hav did, he would hav rigged a rudder on
the animal, and run him into port, and either klaimed the ile
for salvage, or sold out his chanse.</p>

<p><i>Richard.</i>—Yu done wisely tew ask me questions in <i>Natral
history</i>. I am perfektly at hum amung beasts, burds, and
fishes. I kan tell whi the flea bights, whi the bull bellers,
and whi the rinosseross hasn’t got but one tusk, and that on
the top of his knoze. I hav writ the biography ov all
theze kritters, from
the genial muskeeter
and pensiv cockroach
klean up tew
the elephant, with
hiz trunk, and the
lion, who hain’t got
enny trunk at all.
You ask me about
the zebra. The zebra
iz a striped hoss,
the wildesst thing in
natral history ov hiz
size, and az hard
tew civilize az the
hyena, and az useless,
when civilized,
az the osstritch or the
rattlesnaik. They
don’t inhabit the United States at large; they may liv in
Kanda, if they hav a mind to—I never hav been thare tew
diskover. They are about the size ov a moderate mule, but
they kant kik with the mule. Thare ain’t nothing that kiks
for phun or kiks for a living that kan outkik a mule, except
it iz an old-fashioned, Continental, revolushionary war, Fourth
ov July musket. Put about 3 and a haff inches ov powder
<span id="pg_491" class="page_anchor">491 </span>
into one ov theze old vetrans of 1776, ram it down heavy,
and lay it on a stump, and tutch it oph with a slo match, and
I had just az leafs stand in front ov it az tew stand in the
rear ov it. Thare iz sum ov the oldest and crossest ov theze
muskets that will kik, and even squeal, if yu go near them,
whether they are loaded or not. The zebra iz ov no use
whatever only tew look at, at 25 cents a chance, in sum circus
tent, but after they are broke they are spilte for enny thing
else. They are like all other wild animals—fleet only for a short
distance; and civilizashun iz a grate damage tew them, just
az it iz tew an injun. Deth iz the only kind ov civilizashun
that an injun kan understand.</p>

<p><i>Caroline.</i>—Yu ask me whi i dont write sweet, and sentimental,
and luvly things.</p>

<p>I aint bilt right, Caroline, for that kind ov labor.</p>

<p>I am tew round-shouldered, tew write perfumed sentances.</p>

<p>When i git hold ov an idee, i hav tew let it go out, into
the world, like a bird oph from mi hand, bareheaded, and
barefooted, a sort ov vagrant.</p>

<p>If i should undertake tew dress it up in fine clothes, sum
folks would say i stole the idee, and other folks would say i
tried tew steal the clothes, tew dress it in, and got ketched at
it.</p>

<p>I make no pretentions tew literature, i pay no homage tew
elegant sentances, i had rather be the father ov one genuine,
original truth, i don’t kare if it iz az humpbacked az a drumudary,
than tew be the author ov a whole volume ov glittering
cadences, gotten up, for wintergreen-eating schoolgirls
tew nibble at.</p>

<p><i>Benjamin.</i>—Horace Greeley iz not what may be termed
a praktikal farmer, he iz what iz kalled a dikshionary farmer.</p>

<p>The papers tell us he looks for cabages on trees, digs for
apples, hunts stun walls for hens eggs, haz tried tew improve
the flavor ov mutton, by a kross ov the hidraulik ram on the
south-down, splits the duks feet, so they kan stand a fair
chance with a hen when they cum tew the skratch, combs hiz
roosters heds, by cutting oph their topnots, lathers and shaves
<span id="pg_492" class="page_anchor">492 </span>
hiz phatting hogs 3 times a week, makes his cows wear
greengogles, so they will mistake shavings, and peabrush for
clover, piks hiz geese once in 24 hours tew keep them cool,
and throws away the feathers, digs a hoel in the ground and
plants oats, a pek in a place, and runs a grind stun, and two
pattent churns, by konnekting sum kind ov a pattent kontrivance
to hiz cows tails in fli time.</p>

<p>Now if theze fakts are trew, Horace Greely iz not a praktikal
farmer, he iz only a genius in husbandry a hundred
years ahed ov the time.</p>

<p>I haven’t mutch doubt miself a hundred years from now
science and theory, and book larning will have so changed
agrikultur that every time a hen laze an egg, they won’t indulge
in the silly kackel they do now, but will sing sum lively
air, and the old rooster will dance tew the musik in front ov
the nest.</p>

<p>Thare iz a good time comeing, so we are told, and we have
waited so long for it, we might az well hang on now till it

<p><i>Prudence.</i>—I received yure kind letter yesterday, and

<p><i>I don’t kno what a Dolly Varden iz.</i></p>

<p>I kno that all the ladys, when they walk out, hav an immense
sight of clothes, all in one spot, about the center ov
their backs, but whether this iz a Dolly Varden, or knot, I
dont kno, and darsent ask.</p>

<p>I hav looked in Webster unabridged, and kant find it
thare. I hav waded in the ensiklopedio, and lo! it aint
thare. I have asked all mi bacheler friends, and they blush,
and begin tew talk about the poets, Longfellow and Harry
Bassett. I have spoke tew married men about it, (I am married
too) and they say “<i>hush</i>” and pass on in a grate hurry,
and I begin tew guess, the whole thing iz a kussid sell, got
up expressly to Bear the market.</p>

<p>Prudence, I giv it up square, I dont kno what a Dolly
Varden iz, and I aint a going tew try to find out enny more
nuther, for I am satisfied, from what I hav found out about

ponds, up sluggish streams, into the country.</p>

<p>They kant liv in swift water, they are too lazy tew ketch
their breth in it.</p>

<p>They are az tasteless az a merino potatoe, and az for general
intelligence, are jist about on a par, with a korn kob.</p>

<p>Modesty never grows stale, but buty iz like bukwheat
kakes, aint good kold, nor warmed up nex day.</p>

<p>We konsider buty one ov the best <i>kollatterals</i> that a woman
kan possess, but if she haint got nothing else but buty, she
aint no better off than she would be with a life insurance

<p>“<i>Thomas.</i>”—“Jordan is a hard road to travel,” i kant tell
you who was the inventor ov this saying, sum foot sore cus
probably, who waz too lazy to keep a hoss and waggon, or
else a hotel darkey
carryin’ trunks all day.</p>

<p class="caption">A HARD ROAD TO TRABBLE.</p>
</div>

<p>“<i>Ferdinand.</i>”—“Man
wants but little here
belo, nor wants that
little long,” iz a libel,
man <i>wants</i> evrything
he kan see, or hear ov,
and never is willing to
let go ov hiz grab.
Whenever yu find a
man who iz thoroughly
satisfied with what he
has got, yu will find
either an ideot, or one
who haz tried to git
more and couldn’t do it.</p>

<p>The older a man
grows, the more wantful
he bekums, and az hiz hold on life slakens, hiz pinch on a
dollar grows grippy.</p>

<p>“<i>Herod.</i>”—He that puts a small value on hiz services,
issues proposals tew the lowest bidder. When yu make a
request ov divine Providence, it iz best to be modest, if yu
expekt to git what you ask for, but there is so little modesty
in the world, between men, that when we cum acrost it, we
mistake it for ignorance or imbecility. Yu will often see
little boys ketching flies, and killing them just for fun, but
you don’t see them ketch hornets just for fun. The sting in
the hornet’s tail iz what makes him respektable.</p>

<p>“<i>Miller.</i>”—Yu hav got it right the fust time, ingratitude
is one ov them crimes that evry boddy sticks up their noze
<span id="pg_495" class="page_anchor">495 </span>
at, it is the worst insult we kan giv, or receive, it lets a man
drop down belo the level ov the dum brutes, for the yellowest,
and meanest dog in the United States wags hiz tail, if yu
throw him but a burnt crust. What an awful thought it iz,
that ingratitude iz the common sin against God.</p>

<p>“<i>Matilda.</i>”—Kissing is one ov the rudiments, babys are
learnt it instead ov the alphabet, but they dont understand
the strong points in it, yet they seem tew luv it without knowing
why, this iz a bricky argument that kissing iz one ov naturs
most natural noshuns. I kant tell yu whether thare is enny
pertikular etiket to be observed in administrating a kiss or not.
Between lovers it iz sumtimes usual to kiss and hang on, but
it strikes me that the best way iz tew cum up frunt face, in
single file, then fire and fall back one pace, this gives the
patients a chance tew get the flavour. The grate buty ov a
kiss lies in its impulsiveness, and in its impressibility, two
pretty big words, but worth the munny.</p>

<p>I haven’t dun enny thing in the kissing line, (ov an amateur
natur,) ov late years, and there may be sum new dodge,
that i aint posted in, but the old-fashioned, 25 year ago kind,
i remember fresh, that kind didn’t hav enny mathematicks
in it, but waz more like spontaneous combustion.</p>

<p>Kissing, az a general thing, iz not very interesting tew bystanders,
and iz sumtimes even looked upon, by a third party,
az uncalled-for.</p>

<p>“<i>Warwick.</i>”—“He that giveth tew the poor, lendeth tew
the Lord,” if yu had read yure Bible az mutch az i hav, yu
wouldn’t hav asked me if Shakespeare wrote this remark.</p>

<p>Charity iz az mutch ov a privilege, az it iz a duty, and lending
to the Lord, iz undoubted security, for enny man’s munny.</p>

<p>He that gives nothing away while living, dies a bankrupt,
and hiz estate iz generally settled by hiz heirs, a good deal
az the crows settle a ded hoss, by pitching into the remains.</p>

<p>Thare iz menny folks whoze hearts bile with charity, but
whoze extremitys are cold, a half a dollar kontrakts tew a 3
cent piece, by the time it reaches the end ov their fingers.</p>

<p>“<i>Gildad.</i>”—Yure juicy letter haz questions enuff tew make
<span id="pg_496" class="page_anchor">496 </span>
a distrikt-school-master faint, and if i should answer them all,
yu would be fuller ov edukashun than an aulmanak.</p>

<p>Who the author ov the saying, “the good die yung,” waz,
i don’t care, but i will remark, if that iz a good bet, the yunger
a man kan die the better; and not tew be born at all, iz a ded
sure thing.</p>

<p>Again, az it regards the number ov years that a kat kan
live, that depends entirely upon circumstances, they kant liv
over Sunday with me.</p>

<p>“<i>Abel.</i>”—Yu kant pick out a hipokrite by his looks, enny
more than yu kan a fat oyster by the shell, they are frequently
like an old musket, laid away up garret, hav often bin known,
tew let oph a charge, that had been sleeping, with one eye
open, for 3 years. They are like silver-plated forks, wear
well for a long time, but are sure to show the odious brass at
last.</p>

<p>“<i>Hannibal.</i>”—Giving presents, with the hope of receiving
presents in return, takes away awl the cream ov giving, or
receiving, it is like swopping skim-milk, for milk that has bin
skimd.</p>

<p>“<i>Mercury.</i>”—“Owe for a lodge in sum vast wilderness,”
waz the private opinion of Mr. Cowper, one ov the very few
men, who hav lived yet, who waz pure enuff, tew monopolize
a woods, without enny company but his soul, and the God who
made it. Most people holler for solitude without thinking
that it iz a thickly settled place, full ov memorys. Solitude
is the last place for a good man to go to, and the only place
that a wicked man kant liv in. Even wild beasts dont like
solitude, and luv tew see the smoke ov a chimbly. Solitude,
in small doses, iz all well enuff, but 25 miles square ov it,
would make most men, either a counterfiter, or a hoss thief.</p>

<h2 id="sec-202">JOSH BILLINGS CORRESPONDS WITH A “HAIR
OIL AND VEGETABLE BITTERS MAN.”</h2>

<p><i>Dear Doktor Hirsute</i>:—I reseaved a tin cup ov yure “Hair
purswader,” also a bottle ov yure <ins title="Note: opening quote missing in the original" id="cg_73">“</ins>Salvashun Bitters,” bi
express, for which, I express my thanks.</p>

<p>The greenbak, which yu enklozed waz the kind ov purswader
that we ov the press fully understand.</p>

<p>Yur hair grease, shall hav a reglar gimnastik puff, jist az
soon az i kan find a spare time.</p>

<p>I tried a little ov it on an old counter brush in my offiss,
this morning, and in 15 minnitts, the brussells grew long az
a hosses tale, and i notis this afternoon, the hair begins tew
cum up thru, on bak ov the brush, ’tis really wonderful! ’tis
almoste Eureka! I rubbed a drop or two on the head ov mi
cane, which haz bin bald for more than 5 years, and beggar
me! if I don’t hav to shave the cane handle, evry day, before
I can walk out with it.</p>

<p>I hav a verry favrite cat, she iz one ov the Hambletonian
breed ov cats, and altho she iz yung, and haint bin trained
yet, she shows grate signs ov speed.</p>

<p>I thought I would just rub the corck ov the bottle on the
floor, in the corner ov the room whare the cat generally
repozes.</p>

<p>The consequents waz, sum ov the “purswader” got onto
the hair ov the cat’s tale.</p>

<p>When the cat aroze from her slumbers she caught sight ov
her tale, which had growed tew an exalted size; taking one
<span id="pg_498" class="page_anchor">498 </span>
more look at the tale, she started, and bi the good olde Moses!
sich running; across the yard! over the fence! up wun side
ov an apple tree! and down the other! out into the fields,
away! away! The laste i saw ov the cat, she waz pretty
mutch awl tale.</p>

<div class="illustration full" id="ill-96">
<a href="images/ill-97.jpg"><img src="images/ill-97_min.jpg" alt=""></a>
</div>

<p>I wouldn’t hav took 10 dollars for the cat, with her old
tale on her.</p>

<p>In a fu daze, i shall find a spare time, and then i shall write
<span id="pg_499" class="page_anchor">499 </span>
up, for our paper sumthing pyroteknik, which will make the
hair grow on the head ov a number 2 mackrel, to read it.</p>

<p>Dear Dokter, the fact iz, “sum men are born grate, sum
men git grate after they are born, and sum men hav grateness
hove upon them.”</p>

<p>Doctor, you are awl 3 ov these men, in one.</p>

<p>Yu are a kind ov vegitable trinity, sassyfrass, pokeroot,
and elderberry.</p>

<p>It waz a happee thought in you, tew call your “Salvashun
Bitters” a “vegatabel tonicks,” although, old rye aint one ov
the vegatabels, whiskee iz one ov the tonicks.</p>

<p>The people must hev tonicks, and the more vegatabels you
kan git into the gratest amount ov whiskee, the more the peopel
will luv you.</p>

<p>Thare is nothing the christian world long for so mutch, just
now, as a vegatabel bitter.</p>

<p>Sassyfrass is good for a lonesum stummuk, pokeroot is an
alteratiff, and Elderberry was known to the anshients, but
what! oh tell me what! yee whispring winds, what! are
all these without whiskee.</p>

<p>Thank the Lord, that at laste, we hav got a bitter, that
will tonick a man up.</p>

<p>Nothing, sinze the good old daze ov Jamaka Rum, and
sider Brandee, haz sent sich a thrill ov joy thru the wurld, az
“Hirsute’s Salvashun Bitters,” sold respektably bi awl druggists,
far and near.</p>

<p>Go on Doktur, manafaktring, and selling, let the cod liver,
and pattent truss men, howl out in envy, let pills rant, and
plasters rave, you hav got what the wurld wants, and will
have, and that iz, an erb bitter, with a broad whiskee basis.</p>

<p>P. S.—Let me advize yu az a friend; if it iz indispensible
necessary tew cheat a little, in the manufakter ov the “Salvashun
Bitters,” let it by awl means be in the rutes, dont
lower the basis.</p>

<h3 id="sec-203-1">THE GASSY MAN.</h3>

<p>The gassy man iz a kind ov itinerant soda fountain, a sort
ov hi-preshure reservoi ov soap-suds, who spouts bubles and
foam, whenever he opens hiz mouth.</p>

<p>Theze quacks in the small beer line, hav but phew branes,
but their branes are like yeast, they kant rize without running
over every thing.</p>

<p>I have known them tew argy a point 3 hours and a half,
and never offer one good reazon in the whole time.</p>

<p>They mistake words for ideas, and their tongues travel
<span id="pg_501" class="page_anchor">501 </span>
tew just about az mutch purpose az a boy’s wind mill duz,
in the teeth ov a stiff nor wester.</p>

<p>They are the vainest ov all human beings that hav yit bin
discovered, and think, bekauze people kant eskape their furios
effervescence, they are pleazed and convinced.</p>

<p>I never knu one ov theze windmills yet, but what thought
Soloman waz almost an ideot kompared tew them, and I
never knu one to ever diskover hiz mistake.</p>

<p>Yu mite az well undertake tew git the pride out ov a
pekocks tail, bi laffing at it, az to convinse theze phellows
that what they say aint either wit or wisdum.</p>

<p>The gassy man iz not bi enny means a bad man at heart,
he iz often az good natured az he is phoolish, but hiz friendship
aint worth mutch more tew yu than the luv ov a lost
pup, who iz reddy tew phollow enny one off who will pat
him on the back.</p>

<h3 id="sec-203-2">THE SHARP MAN.</h3>

<p>The sharp man iz often mistaken for the wize one, but
he iz just az diffrent from a wize one az he iz from an honest
one.</p>

<p>He trusts tew hiz cunning for suckcess, and this iz the
next thing to being a rogue.</p>

<p>The sharp man iz like a razor—generally too sharp for
enny thing but a shave.</p>

<p>Theze men are not tew be trusted—they are so constituted
that they must cheat sumboddy, and, rather than be idle or
lose a good job, they will pitch onto their best friends.</p>

<p>They are not exackly outkasts, but liv cluss on the borders
ov criminality, and are liable tew step over at enny
time.</p>

<p>It iz but a step from cunning tew raskality, and it iz a
step that iz alwuss inviting to take.</p>

<p>Sharp men hav but phew friends, and seldum a konfident.
They hav learnt tew fear treachery by studying their own
naturs.</p>

<p>They are alwuss bizzy, but like the hornet, want a heap ov
sharp watching.</p>

<span id="pg_502" class="page_anchor">502 </span>

<p>The sharp man iz alwuss a vain one. He prides himself
upon his cunning, and had rather do a shrewd thing than a
kind one.</p>

<h3 id="sec-203-3">THE LAZY MAN.</h3>

<p>Next tew the weak man the lazy man iz the wust one i
kno ov, without necessarily being a viscious one.</p>

<p>He iz too indolent tew praktiss hiz virtews, if he haz got
enny, and therefore iz konstantly open tew vice, which iz
haff-brother tew lazyness.</p>

<p>It iz hard work tew phind lazyness and virtew mixt, but
thare iz sitch a thing.</p>

<p>Indolence iz one ov the wust mildews i kno ov—it iz the
grate leak that haz let thousands ov men drizzle away.</p>

<p>Lazyness iz not positively a crime, but they look and akt
wonderphully alike.</p>

<p>Lazyness iz not ornamental even tew an old man, but tew
a yung one it iz a shining disgrase.</p>

<p>I hav seen lazy men that i thought waz innocent, but i
never felt like warrenting one ov them for more than 90
daze.</p>

<h3 id="sec-203-4">THE NERVOUS MAN.</h3>

<p>One ov the most unkumfortable kritters in this world iz
the nervus man. He discounts all hiz griefs, and suffers
more from trubbles that never happen, than enny boddy else
duz from trubbles that do cum.</p>

<p>Hiz ears are like a rabbits, always on end for sum disaster,
and hiz nostrils are like the asses, snuffing misfortune out ov
the east wind.</p>

<p>He steps az though he waz walking on eggs, and lays down
like a kat in frunt ov a rat hole, reddy for a spring.</p>

<p>Theze poor phellows suffer without simpathy, and enjoy
without satisfacshun.</p>

<p>The nervous man iz a long lived bird, though hiz nerves
are alwus strung, he lasts like an old phiddle.</p>

<p>Altho i kant help but pitty the nervus man i am aware
<span id="pg_503" class="page_anchor">503 </span>
that he haz moments ov plezzure that are equal tew whole
hours, they are so intensified.</p>

<p>Whatever he duz enjoy he enjoys the whole ov, passing
the bounds ov reality, he revels in the illimitable fields ov
imaginashun and fancy.</p>

<p>I think I would rather have more nerves than i could
manage than not tew hav enny, and mope on thru life az
sum men do, with nothing about me so exciteable az mi relish
for pork and beans.</p>

<h3 id="sec-203-5">THE DIGNIFIED MAN.</h3>

<p>It iz often the kase that the dignified man iz nothing more
than an owl amung humans.</p>

<p>He dont alwus kno but little, but when he duz he haz tew
be kareful ov that little and look wize even if he dont prove
tew be so.</p>

<p>One good hoss laff would spile him for life; if he lets go
ov hiz dignity, hiz kapital iz all gone and he iz ruined forever.</p>

<p>The dignified man that i am talking about, never takes
enny chances, he weighs every word before it iz uttered, and
meazzures every ackshun before it iz expressed, and iz generally
az free from blunders, or hits, az a tud stool iz. If he
ever duz kik up and frolik he iz like the elastik elephant, and
gay and kussid like the hippopotamus or wild sea hoss.</p>

<p>Dignity iz often substituted for wisdum, and iz quite often
mistaken for it, but thare iz az mutch diffrence between them
az thare iz between a puter 10 cent piece and a genuine haff
dollar.</p>

<p>I decided long ago not tew giv enny man kredit for being
wize, just bekauze he wouldn’t bend hiz back or laff when he
had a right tew be tickled.</p>

<p>Sum ov the most suckcessfull phools i hav ever met were
as grave az a kut stone, and most all the truly wize that i
hav had the honor tew be introduced to, were alwuss a hunting
for a good place tew roll on the grass.</p>

<p>Extreme gravity, in mi lexicon, stands for an extreme
phool.</p>

<span id="pg_504" class="page_anchor">504 </span>

<h3 id="sec-203-6">THE WEAK MAN.</h3>

<p>A weak man wants just about az mutch watching az a
bad one, and haz dun just about as mutch damage in the
world.</p>

<p>He iz every boddy’s friend, and tharefore he iz no ones,
and what he iz a going tew do next iz az unknown tew him
as tew others.</p>

<p>He haint got enny more backbone than an angleworm haz,
and wiggles in and wiggles out ov every thing.</p>

<p>He will talk to-day like a wize man, and to-morrow like a
phool, on the same subjekt.</p>

<p>He alwuss sez “Yes,” when he should say “No,” and
staggers thru life like a drunken man.</p>

<p>Heaven save us from the weak man, whoze deseptions hav
no fraud in them, and whoze friendships are the wuss
desighns he kan hav on us.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
